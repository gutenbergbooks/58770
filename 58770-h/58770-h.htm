<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>THE MYSTERIOUS NUMBER SEVEN.</small></h2></div>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Are</span> you flying &#8216;The Hornet&#8217; to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were up last night, weren&#8217;t you? Mac
told me so at Brooklands this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;Zepp-hunting. I was up three hours,
but, alas! had no luck. Two came in over
Essex but were scared by the anti-aircraft boys,
and turned tail. Better luck to-night, I hope,&#8221;
and Ronald Pryor, the tall, dark, good-looking
young man in grey flannels, laughed merrily
as, with a quick movement, he flicked the ash
from his after-luncheon cigarette.</p>

<p>His companion, George Bellingham, who was
in the uniform of the Royal Flying Corps, wearing
the silver wings of the pilot, was perhaps three
years his senior, fair-haired, grey-eyed, with
a small sandy moustache trimmed to the most
correct cut.</p>

<p>Passers-by in Pall Mall on that June afternoon
no doubt wondered why Ronald Pryor was not
in khaki. As a matter of fact, the handsome,
athletic young fellow had already done his bit&mdash;and
done it with very great honour and
distinction.</p>

<p>Before the war he had been of little good to
society, it is true. He had been one of those
modern dandies whose accomplishments include<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
an elegant taste in socks&mdash;with ties to match&mdash;and
a critical eye for an ill-cut pair of trousers.
Eldest son of a wealthy bank-director, Ronnie
Pryor had been born with the proverbial silver
spoon in his mouth. After his career at Oxford,
his father, Henry Pryor, who lived mostly at
his beautiful old place, Urchfont Hall, a few miles
out of Norwich, had given him an ample
allowance. He had lived in a bachelor flat in
Duke Street, St. James&#8217;s, and spent several
gay years about town with kindred souls of both
sexes, becoming a familiar object each night at
the supper-tables of the Savoy, the Carlton,
or the Ritz.</p>

<p>This wild oat sowing had, however, been
brought to an abrupt conclusion in a rather
curious manner.</p>

<p>One Saturday afternoon he had driven in a
friend&#8217;s car over to the Aerodrome at Hendon,
and had there witnessed some graceful flying.
He had instantly become &#8220;bitten&#8221; by the sport,
and from that moment had devoted himself
assiduously to it.</p>

<p>Four months later he had taken his &#8220;ticket&#8221;
as a pilot, and then, assisted by capital from his
indulgent father, had entered business by establishing
the well-known Pryor Aeroplane Factory
at Weybridge, with a branch at Hendon, a
business in which his companion, Flight-Lieutenant
George Bellingham, of the Royal
Flying Corps, had been, and was still, financially
interested.</p>

<p>That Ronnie Pryor&mdash;as everyone called him&mdash;was
a handsome fellow could not be denied.
His was a strongly marked personality, clean-limbed,
with close-cut dark hair, a refined
aquiline face, and that slight contraction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
eyebrows that every air-pilot so quickly develops.
On the outbreak of war he had been out with
General French, had been through the retreat
from Mons, and while scouting in the air during
the first battle of Ypres, had been attacked by
a German Taube. A fierce and intensely exciting
fight in the air ensued, as a result of which he
brought his enemy down within our own lines,
but unfortunately received a severe wound in
the stomach himself, and, planing down, reached
earth safely a long distance away and collapsed
unconscious.</p>

<p>The condition of his health was such that the
Medical Board refused to pass him for service
abroad again, therefore he was now devoting
his time to building aeroplanes for the Government,
and frequently flying them at night, thus
assisting in the aerial defence of our coast, and
of London.</p>

<p>Ronnie Pryor was known as one of the most
daring and intrepid air-pilots that we possessed.
Before his crash he had brought down quite a
number of his adversaries in the air, for the
manner in which he could manipulate his machine,
&#8220;zumming,&#8221; diving, rising, and flying a zigzag
course, avoiding the enemy&#8217;s fire, was marvellous.
Indeed, it was he who one afternoon dropped
nine bombs upon the enemy&#8217;s aerodrome at
Oudenarde, being mentioned in despatches for
that daring exploit.</p>

<p>His one regret was that the doctor considered
him &#8220;crocked.&#8221; Discarding his uniform he,
in defiance of everybody, flew constantly in the
big biplane which he himself had built, and
which the boys at Hendon had nicknamed &#8220;The
Hornet.&#8221; The machine was a &#8220;strafer,&#8221; of the
most formidable type, with an engine of two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
hundred and fifty horse-power, fitted with a
Lewis gun and a rack for bombs, while no more
daring airman ever sat at a joy-stick than its
owner.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re running that new Anzani engine
on the bench at Hendon,&#8221; Bellingham remarked
presently. &#8220;I&#8217;m going out to see it. Come
with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ronnie considered for a few seconds, and
then accepted the suggestion, he driving his
partner out to Hendon in his yellow car which
had been standing in St. James&#8217;s Square.</p>

<p>At the busy aerodrome, where all sorts of
machines were being assembled and tested, they
entered the spacious workshops of the Pryor
Aeroplane Factory where, in one corner, amid
whirring machinery, a large aeroplane-engine was
running at top speed with a hum that was deafening
in the confined space.</p>

<p>Half-an-hour later both men went forth again
into the aerodrome where several &#8220;school &#8217;buses&#8221;
were being flown by pupils of the flying school.
Suddenly Bellingham&#8217;s quick airman&#8217;s eye caught
sight of a biplane at a great height coming from
the north-west.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, isn&#8217;t that Beryl up in your &#8217;bus?&#8221;
he exclaimed, pointing out the machine. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t know she was out to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was Ronnie&#8217;s reply. &#8220;She flew over
to Huntingdon this morning to see her sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was she up with you last night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. She generally goes up daily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has wonderful nerve for a woman,&#8221;
declared George. &#8220;A pupil who has done great
credit to her tutor&mdash;yourself, Ronnie. How
many times has she flown the Channel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seven. Three times alone, and four with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
me. The last time she crossed alone she went
up from Bedford and landed close to Berck,
beyond Paris-Plage. She passed over Folkestone,
and then over to Cape Grisnez.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at her now!&#8221; Bellingham exclaimed
in admiration. &#8220;By Jove! She&#8217;s doing a good
stunt!&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke the aeroplane which Beryl Gaselee
was flying, that great battleplane of Ronnie&#8217;s
invention&mdash;&#8220;The Hornet,&#8221; as they had named
it on account of a certain politician&#8217;s reassurance&mdash;circled
high in the air above the aerodrome,
making a high-pitched hum quite different
from that of the other machines in the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s taken the silencer off,&#8221; Ronnie
remarked. &#8220;She&#8217;s in a hurry, no doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That silencer of yours is a marvellous invention,&#8221;
George declared. &#8220;Thank goodness Fritz
hasn&#8217;t got it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ronnie smiled, and selecting a cigarette from
his case, tapped it down and slowly lit it, his
eyes upon the machine now hovering like a great
hawk above them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can run her so that at a thousand feet up
nobody below can hear a sound,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;That&#8217;s where we&#8217;ve got the pull for night
bombing. A touch on the lever and the exhaust
is silent, so that the enemy can&#8217;t hear us come up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s a deuced cute invention,&#8221; declared
his partner. &#8220;It saved me that night a month
ago when I got over Alost and put a few incendiary
pills into the German barracks. I got away in
the darkness and, though half-a-dozen machines
went up, they couldn&#8217;t find me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The enemy would dearly like to get hold of
the secret,&#8221; laughed Ronnie. &#8220;But all of us keep
it guarded too carefully.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said his partner, as they watched with
admiring eyes, how Beryl Gaselee, the intrepid
woman aviator, was manipulating the big
battleplane in her descent. &#8220;Your invention
for the keeping of the secret, my dear fellow, is
quite as clever as the invention itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The new silencer for aeroplane-engines Ronnie
Pryor had offered to the authorities, and as it
was still under consideration, he kept it strictly
to himself. Only he, his mechanic, Beryl and
his partner George Bellingham, knew its true
mechanism, and so careful was he to conceal
it from the enemy in our midst, that he had also
invented a clever contrivance by which, with
a turn of a winged nut, the valve came apart,
so that the chief portion&mdash;which was a secret&mdash;could
be placed in one&#8217;s pocket, and carried away
whenever the machines were left.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want any frills from you, old man,&#8221;
laughed the merry, easy-going young fellow in
flannels. &#8220;I&#8217;m only trying to do my best for
my country, just as you have done, and just as
Beryl is doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beryl is a real brick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You say that because we are pals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Ronnie. I say it because it&#8217;s the rock-bottom
truth; because Miss Gaselee, thanks to
your tuition, is one of the very few women who
have come to the front as aviators in the war.
She knows how to fly as well as any Squadron
Commander. Look at her now! Just look at
the spiral she&#8217;s making. Neither of us could do
it better. Her engine, too, is running like a
clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, as the two aviators watched, the great
battleplane swept round and round the aerodrome,
quickly dropping from twelve thousand feet&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
height at which they had first noticed its
approach&mdash;towards the wide expanse of grass
that was the landing-place.</p>

<p>At last &#8220;The Hornet,&#8221; humming loudly like
a huge bumblebee, touched earth and came to
a standstill, while Ronnie ran forward to help
his well-beloved out of the pilot&#8217;s seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, Ronnie!&#8221; cried the fresh-faced,
athletic girl merrily. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect to find
you here! I thought you&#8217;d gone to Harbury,
and I intended to fly over and find you there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ran out here with George to see that new
engine running on the bench,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;Come and have some tea. You must want some.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl, in her workmanlike air-woman&#8217;s
windproof overalls, her &#8220;grummet&#8221;&mdash;which in
aerodrome-parlance means headgear&mdash;her big
goggles and thick gauntlet-gloves, rose from her
seat, whilst her lover took her tenderly in his
arms and lifted her out upon the ground.</p>

<p>Then, after a glance at the altimeter, he
remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, Beryl! You&#8217;ve been flying pretty
high&mdash;thirteen thousand four hundred feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; laughed the girl merrily. &#8220;The
weather this afternoon is perfect for a stunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, after the young man had gone to the
exhaust, unscrewed the silencer and placed the
secret part in his pocket, the pair walked across
to the tea-room and there sat <i>tête-à-tête</i> upon
the verandah gossiping.</p>

<p>Beryl Gaselee was, perhaps, the best-known
flying-woman in the United Kingdom. There
were others, but none so expert nor so daring.
She would fly when the pylon pilots&mdash;as the ornate
gentlemen of the aerodromes are called&mdash;shook
their heads and refused to go up.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>Soft-featured, with pretty, fair and rather
fluffy hair, and quite devoid of that curious
hardness of feature which usually distinguishes
the female athlete, her age was twenty-three, her
figure slightly <i>petite</i> and quite slim. Indeed,
many airmen who knew her were amazed that
such a frail-looking little person could manage
such a big, powerful machine as Ronnie Pryor&#8217;s
&#8220;Hornet&#8221;&mdash;the &#8217;bus which was the last word
in battleplanes both for rapid rising and for
speed.</p>

<p>The way in which she manipulated the joy-stick
often, indeed, astonished Ronnie himself.
But her confidence in herself, and in the stability
of the machine, was so complete that such a
thing as possible disaster never occurred to her.</p>

<p>As she sat at the tea-table, her cheeks fresh
and reddened by the cutting wind at such an
altitude, a wisp of fair hair straying across her
face, and her big, wide-open blue eyes aglow
with the pleasure of living, she presented a charming
figure of that feminine type that is so purely
English. They were truly an interesting pair,
a fact which had apparently become impressed
upon a middle-aged air-mechanic in brown overalls
who, in passing the verandah upon which they
were seated, looked up and cast a furtive glance
at them.</p>

<p>Both were far too absorbed in each other to
notice the man&#8217;s unusual interest, or the expression
of suppressed excitement upon his grimy
face, as he watched them with covert glance.
Had they seen it, they might possibly have been
curious as to the real reason. As it was, they
remained in blissful ignorance, happy in each
other&#8217;s confidence and love.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the weather for another Zepp raid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
to-night,&#8221; Ronnie was remarking. &#8220;No moon
to speak of, wind just right for them, and a high
barometer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why you&#8217;re going to Harbury this
evening, in readiness to go up, I suppose?&#8221;
she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll let me go with you, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;
she begged, as she poured him his second cup
of tea with dainty hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were up last night, and you&#8217;ve been
for a long joy-ride to-day. I think it would
really be too great a strain, Beryl, for you to go
out to-night,&#8221; he protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it won&#8217;t. Do let me go, dear!&#8221; she
urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he replied, always unable to
refuse her, as she knew full well. &#8220;In that case
we&#8217;ll fly over to Harbury now, and put the &#8217;bus
away till to-night. I&#8217;ve sent Collins out there
in readiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, half-an-hour later, &#8220;The Hornet,&#8221; with
Ronnie at the joy-stick and Beryl in the observer&#8217;s
seat, rose again from the grass and, after a
couple of turns around the pylons, ascended
rapidly, heading north-east.</p>

<p>As it did so, the dark-eyed mechanic in the
brown overalls stood watching it grow smaller
until it passed out of sight.</p>

<p>For some minutes he remained silent and
pensive, his heavy brows knit as he watched.
Then, suddenly turning upon his heel, he muttered
to himself and walked to one of the flying schools
where he, Henry Knowles, was employed as a
mechanic on the &#8217;buses flown by the men training
as air-pilots for the Front.</p>

<p>In a little over half-an-hour the big biplane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
with its loud hum travelled nearly forty miles
from Hendon, until at last Ronnie, descending
in search of his landmark, discovered a small
river winding through the panorama of patchwork
fields, small dark patches of woods, and little
clusters of houses which, in the sundown, denoted
villages and hamlets. This stream he followed
until Beryl suddenly touched his arm&mdash;speech
being impossible amid the roar of the engine&mdash;and
pointed below to where, a little to the left,
there showed the thin, grey spire of an ivy-clad
village church and a circular object close by&mdash;the
village gasometer.</p>

<p>The gasometer was their landmark.</p>

<p>Ronnie nodded, and then he quickly banked
and came down upon a low hill of pastures and
woods about five miles east of the church spire.</p>

<p>The meadow wherein they glided to earth
in the golden sunset was some distance from a
small hamlet which lay down in the valley
through which ran a stream glistening in the light,
and turning an old-fashioned water-mill on its
course. Then, as Ronnie unstrapped himself
from his seat and hopped out, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, dear! You must rest for an hour or
two, otherwise I shall not allow you to go up with
me after Zepps to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>His smart young mechanic, a fellow named
Collins, from the aeroplane works came running
up, while Ronnie assisted Beryl out of the machine.</p>

<p>In a corner of the field not far distant was a
long barn of corrugated iron, which Ronnie had
transformed into a hangar for &#8220;The Hornet&#8221;&mdash;and
this they termed &#8220;The Hornet&#8217;s Nest.&#8221;
To this they at once wheeled the great machine,
Beryl bearing her part in doing so and being
assisted by two elderly farm-hands.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>Then Collins, the mechanic, having received
certain instructions, his master and Beryl crossed
the meadow and, passing through a small copse,
found themselves upon the lawn of a large, old-fashioned
house called Harbury Court. The
place, a long, rambling two-storied Georgian one,
with a wide porch and square, inartistic windows,
was partly covered by ivy, while its front was gay
with geraniums and marguerites.</p>

<p>There came forward to meet the pair Beryl&#8217;s
married sister Iris, whose husband, Charles
Remington, a Captain in the Munsters, had been
many months at the Front, and was now, alas!
a prisoner of war in Germany.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard you arrive,&#8221; she said cheerily, addressing
the pair. And then she told them how she
had waited tea for them. Neither being averse
from another cup, the trio passed through the
French window into the big, cool drawing-room
with its bright chintzes, gay flowers, and
interesting bric-a-brac.</p>

<p>While Beryl went half-an-hour later to her
room to rest, and Ronnie joined Collins to test
various portions of the &#8217;bus and its apparatus
before the night flight, a curious scene was taking
place in the top room of a block of new red-brick
flats somewhere in a northern suburb of London&mdash;the
exact situation I am not permitted to
divulge.</p>

<p>From the window a very extensive view could
be obtained over London, both south and east,
where glowed the red haze of sunset upon the
giant metropolis, with its landmarks of tall factory
chimneys, church steeples, and long lines
of slate roofs.</p>

<p>The room was a photographic studio. Indeed,
the neat brass-plate upon the outer door of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
flat bore the name &#8220;R. Goring, Photographer,&#8221;
and as such, its owner was known to other tenants
of the various suites, persons of the upper middle-class,
men mostly occupying good positions in
the City.</p>

<p>True, a whole-plate camera stood upon a stand
in a corner, and there were one or two grey screens
for backgrounds placed against the wall, but
nothing else in the apartment showed that it
was used for the purpose of photography. On
the contrary, it contained a somewhat unusual
apparatus, which two men present were closely
examining.</p>

<p>Upon a strong deal table, set directly beneath
the great skylight&mdash;which had been made to
slide back so as to leave that portion of the roof
open&mdash;was a great circular searchlight, such as
is used upon ships, the glass face of which was
turned upward to the sky.</p>

<p>Set in a circle around its face were a number
of bright reflectors and prisms placed at certain
angles, with, above them, a large brass ring
across which white silk gauze was stretched so
that the intense rays of the searchlight should
be broken up, and not show as a beam in the
darkness, and thus disclose its existence.</p>

<p>At a glance the cleverness of the arrangement
was apparent. It was one of the enemy&#8217;s guiding
lights for Zeppelins!</p>

<p>The owner of the flat, Mr. Goring, a burly,
grey-haired man of fifty-five, was exhibiting
with pride to his visitor a new set of glass prisms
which he had that day set at the proper angle,
while the man who was evincing such interest
was the person who&mdash;only a few hours before&mdash;had
worked in his mechanic&#8217;s overalls, at the
Hendon Aerodrome, the man, Henry Knowles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
who was to all intents and purposes an Englishman,
having been in London since he was three
years of age. Indeed, so well did he speak his
Cockney dialect, that none ever dreamt that he
was the son of one Heinrich Klitz, or that his
Christian name was Hermann.</p>

<p>His host, like himself, was typically English,
and had long ago paid his naturalisation fees and
declared himself of the British bulldog breed. In
public he was a fierce antagonist of Germany.
In strongest terms he denounced the Kaiser
and all his ways. He had even written to the
newspapers deploring Great Britain&#8217;s mistakes,
and, by all about him, was believed to be a fine,
honest, and loyal Englishman. Even his wife,
who now lived near Bristol, believed him to be
British. Yet the truth was that he had no right
to the name of Richard Goring, his baptismal
name being Otto Kohler, his brother Hans
occupying, at that moment, the post of President
of the German Imperial Railways, the handsome
offices of which are numbered 44, Linkstrasse, in
Berlin.</p>

<p>The pair were members of the long-prepared
secret enemy organisation in our midst&mdash;men
living in London as British subjects, and each
having his important part allotted to him to play
at stated times and in pre-arranged places.</p>

<p>Richard Goring&#8217;s work for his country was
to pose as a photographer&mdash;so that his undue
use of electric-light current should not attract
attention&mdash;and to keep that hidden searchlight
burning night after night, in case a Zeppelin
were fortunate enough to get as far as London.</p>

<p>As &#8220;Light-post No. 22&#8221; it was known to those
cunning Teutons who so craftily established in
England the most wonderful espionage system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
ever placed upon the world. In England there
were a number of signallers and &#8220;light-posts&#8221;
for the guidance of enemy aircraft, but this&mdash;one
of the greatest intensity&mdash;was as a lighthouse,
and marked as of first importance upon the aerial
chart carried by every Zeppelin Commander.</p>

<p>Mr. Goring had shown and explained to his
friend the improved mechanism of the light,
whereupon Knowles&mdash;who now wore a smart
blue serge suit and carried gloves in his hand&mdash;laughed
merrily, and replied in English, for they
always talked that language:</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw Gortz at Number Three last night.
He has news from Berlin that the big air raid
is to be made on the fourteenth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fourteenth!&#8221; echoed his friend. Then,
after a second&#8217;s reflection, he added: &#8220;That will
be Friday week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. There will be one or two small
attempts before&mdash;probably one to-night&mdash;a
reconnaissance over the Eastern Counties. At
least it was said so last night at Number Three,&#8221;
he added, referring to a secret meeting place
of the Huns in London.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; laughed the photographic artist. &#8220;I
always keep the light going and, thanks to the
plans they sent me from Wilhelmsplatz a month
before the war, there is no beam of light to betray
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather thanks to the information we have
when the British scouting airships leave their
sheds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, my dear friend. Then I at once
cut it off, of course,&#8221; laughed the other. &#8220;But it
is a weary job&mdash;up here alone each night killing
time by reading their silly newspapers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One of our greatest dangers, in my opinion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
is that young fellow Ronald Pryor&mdash;the aeroplane-builder,&#8221;
declared Knowles. &#8220;The man whom
our friend Reichardt tried to put out of existence
last week, and failed&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The same. He has a new aeroplane called
&#8216;The Hornet,&#8217; which can be rendered quite silent.
That is a very great danger to our airships.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must, at all hazards, ascertain its secret,&#8221;
said his host promptly. &#8220;What does Reichardt
say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were discussing it last night at Number
Three.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then the man who called himself Knowles
and who, by working as a humble mechanic
at a flying school at Hendon, was able to pick
up so many facts concerning our air service,
explained how &#8220;The Hornet&#8221; was kept in secret
somewhere out in Essex&mdash;at some spot which
they had not yet discovered.</p>

<p>&#8220;But surely you&#8217;ll get to know,&#8221; was the other&#8217;s
remark, as he leant idly against the table whereon
lay the complicated apparatus of prisms, and
reflectors which constituted the lighthouse to
guide the enemy aircraft.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the service upon which Number
Seven has placed me,&#8221; was the response.</p>

<p>He had referred to the director of that branch
of the enemy&#8217;s operations in England&mdash;the person
known as &#8220;Number Seven&#8221;&mdash;the cleverly
concealed secret agent who assisted to guide the
invisible hand of Germany in our midst. The
individual in question lived in strictest retirement,
unknown even to those puppets of Berlin
who so blindly obeyed his orders, and who received
such lavish payment for so doing. Some of the
Kaiser&#8217;s secret agents said that he lived in
London; others declared that he lived on a farm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
in a remote village somewhere in Somerset;
while others said he had been seen walking in
Piccadilly with a well-known peeress. Many, on
the other hand, declared that he lived in a small
country town in the guise of a retired shopkeeper,
interested only in his roses and his cucumber-frames.</p>

<p>&#8220;A pity our good friend Reichardt failed the
other day,&#8221; remarked the man who posed as a
photographer. &#8220;What of that girl Gaselee?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The next attempt will not fail, depend upon
it,&#8221; was Knowles&#8217; reply, in tones of confidence.
&#8220;When Ronald Pryor dies, so will she also.
The decision at Number Three last night was
unanimous.&#8221; And he grinned evilly.</p>

<p>Then both men went forth, Goring carefully
locking the door of the secret studio. Then,
passing through the well-furnished flat, he closed
the door behind him, and they descended the
stairs.</p>

<p>That night just after eleven o&#8217;clock, Beryl
in her warm air-woman&#8217;s kit, with her leather
&#8220;grummet&#8221; with its ear-pieces buttoned beneath
her chin, climbed into &#8220;The Hornet&#8221; and
strapped herself into the observer&#8217;s seat.</p>

<p>Collins had been busy on the &#8217;bus all the
evening, testing the powerful dual engines, the
searchlight, the control levers, and a dozen
other details, including the all-important silencer.
Afterwards he had placed in the long rack beneath
the fusilage four high explosive spherical bombs,
with three incendiary ones.</p>

<p>Therefore, when Ronnie hopped in, the machine
was in complete readiness for a night flight.</p>

<p>Arranged at each corner of the big grass-field
was a powerful electric light sunk into the ground
and covered with glass. These could be switched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
on from the house supply and, by means of
reflectors, gave splendid guidance for descent.
At present, however, all was, of course,
in darkness.</p>

<p>The night was windless and overcast, while
the barometer showed the atmospheric pressure
to be exactly that welcomed by Commanders
of enemy airships.</p>

<p>Ronnie after switching on his little light over
the instruments and examining his gauges,
shouted to Collins:</p>

<p>&#8220;Righto! Let her rip!&#8221;</p>

<p>In a moment there was a terrific roar. The
wind whistled about their ears, and next second
they were &#8220;zumming,&#8221; up climbing at an angle
of quite thirty degrees, instead of &#8220;taxi-running&#8221;
the machine before leaving the ground.</p>

<p>Not a star showed, neither did a light. At
that hour the good people of Essex were mostly
in bed.</p>

<p>On their right, as they rose, Beryl noticed one
or two red and green lights of railway signals,
but these faded away as they still climbed ever
up and up, travelling in the direction of the coast.
The roar of the engines was deafening, until they
approached a faintly seen cluster of lights which,
by the map spread before him beneath the tiny
light, Ronnie knew was the town of B&mdash;&mdash;. Then
he suddenly pulled a lever by which the noise
instantly became so deadened that the whirr
of the propeller alone was audible, the engines
being entirely silenced.</p>

<p>The young man, speaking for the first time,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll first run along the coast and scout,
and then turn back inland.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scarcely had he uttered those words when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
suddenly they became blinded by a strong
searchlight from below.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo! Our anti-aircraft boys!&#8221; he
ejaculated and at the same moment he pushed
back the lever, causing the engines to roar again.</p>

<p>The men working the searchlight at once
distinguished the tri-coloured rings upon the
planes, and by its sudden silence and as sudden
roar they knew it to be &#8220;The Hornet.&#8221; Therefore
next second they shut off the beam of the
light, and once again Ronnie silenced his &#8217;bus.</p>

<p>It was then near midnight, and up there at ten
thousand feet the wind was bitingly cold. Moreover
there were one or two air currents which
caused the machine to rock violently in a manner
that would have alarmed any but those
experienced in flying.</p>

<p>Beryl buttoned her collar still more snugly,
but declared that she was not feeling cold.
Below, little or nothing could be seen until, of
a sudden, they ran into a thick cold mist, and
then knew that they were over the sea.</p>

<p>With a glance at his luminous compass, the
cheery young airman quickly turned the machine&#8217;s
nose due south, and a quarter of an hour later altered
his course south-west, heading towards London.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing doing to-night, it seems!&#8221; he
remarked to his companion, as, in the darkness,
they sped along at about fifty miles an hour,
the wind whistling weirdly through the stays,
the propeller humming musically, but the sound
seeming no more than that of a bumblebee on
a summer&#8217;s day.</p>

<p>It was certain that such sound could not be
heard below.</p>

<p>After nearly an hour they realised by certain
unmistakable signs&mdash;mostly atmospheric&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
they were over the outer northern suburbs of
London.</p>

<p>Then, as Ronnie altered his course, in the inky
blackness of the night, both saw, deep below,
an intense white light burning like a beacon,
but throwing no ray.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s curious!&#8221; remarked Pryor to the girl
beside him. &#8220;I can&#8217;t make it out. I&#8217;ve seen
it several times before. One night a month
ago I saw it put out, and then, when one of
our patrolling airships had gone over, it came
suddenly up again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An enemy light for the guiding of enemy
Zeppelins&mdash;eh?&#8221; Beryl suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly my opinion!&#8221; was her lover&#8217;s reply.</p>

<p>As he spoke they passed out of range of vision,
all becoming dark again. Therefore, Ronnie put
down his lever and turned the &#8217;bus quickly so that
he could again examine the mysterious light
which would reveal to the enemy the district
of London over which they were then flying.</p>

<p>For a full quarter of an hour &#8220;The Hornet,&#8221;
having descended to about three thousand feet,
man&oelig;uvred backwards and forwards, crossing
and recrossing exactly over the intense white
light below, Ronnie remaining silent, and flying
the great biplane with most expert skill.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as he passed for the sixth time
directly over the light, he touched a lever, and a
quick swish of air followed.</p>

<p>In a moment the white light was blotted out
by a fierce blood-red one.</p>

<p>No sound of any explosion was heard. But a
second later bright flames leapt up high, and from
where they sat aloft they could clearly distinguish
that the upper story of the house was well alight.</p>

<p>Once again &#8220;The Hornet,&#8221; which had hovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
over the spot, flying very slowly in a circle,
swooped down in silence, for Pryor was eager
to ascertain the result of his well-placed incendiary
bomb.</p>

<p>As, in the darkness, they rapidly neared the
earth, making no sound to attract those below,
Beryl could see that in the streets, lit by
the flames, people were running about like a
swarm of ants. The alarm had already been given
to the fire-brigade, for the faint sound of a fire-bell
now reached their ears.</p>

<p>For five or six minutes Pryor remained in the
vicinity watching the result of the bomb.</p>

<p>Beryl, strapped in, peered below, and then,
placing her eye to the powerful night-glasses,
she could discern distinctly two fire-engines
tearing along to the scene of the conflagration.</p>

<p>Then with a laugh Ronnie pulled over the lever
and, climbing high again, swiftly made off in
the direction of Harbury.</p>

<p>&#8220;That spy won&#8217;t ever show a light again!&#8221;
he remarked grimly.</p>

<p>Next day the newspapers reported a serious
and very mysterious outbreak of fire in a photographic
studio at the top of a certain block of
flats, the charred remains of the occupier, Mr.
Richard Goring, a highly respected resident,
being afterwards found, together with a mass
of mysterious metal apparatus with which he
had apparently been experimenting, and by
which&mdash;as the Coroner&#8217;s jury eventually decided
four days later&mdash;the fatal fire must have been
caused.</p>

<p>One morning Beryl and Ronnie, seated together
in the drawing-room at Harbury, read the
evidence given at the inquest and the verdict.</p>

<p>Both smiled, but neither made remark.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>MR. MARK MARX.</small></h2></div>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">I think</span> we&#8217;ll have to give her another dope,
Collins,&#8221; remarked Ronnie Pryor, as early one
summer&#8217;s morning he stood before &#8220;The Hornet,&#8221;
which, after a night-flight to the sea and back,
was reposing in its &#8220;nest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly wouldn&#8217;t hurt her, sir, especially
if we can get some of that new patent stuff that
Mr. Henderson was telling us about the other
day,&#8221; the young mechanic replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! That&#8217;s a secret,&#8221; laughed his master.
&#8220;It&#8217;s no doubt the finest dope ever invented,
and happily Fritz, with all his scientific attainments,
is still in the dark regarding it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid the enemy will learn the secret
before long, sir,&#8221; the man remarked. &#8220;There
are far too many strangers knocking about the
aerodromes, and prying into everyone&#8217;s business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, Collins, I know,&#8221; remarked Ronnie.
&#8220;They&#8217;re very inquisitive regarding my new
silencer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s quite right, sir. I&#8217;m often being
pumped about it by strangers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I know you never utter a word
concerning it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trust me, sir,&#8221; laughed the clean-shaven
young man. &#8220;I always deny any knowledge
of it. But the people who make the inquiries
seem very shrewd indeed. And the funny thing
is that they are never foreigners.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, I quite realise that. But at all hazards
we must keep the secret of the silencer to
ourselves,&#8221; said Pryor. &#8220;The silencer enables
us to make night-flights in secret without the
enemy being any the wiser,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Collins grinned. He knew, only too well,
how &#8220;The Hornet&#8221; had, more than once, been
over to Belgium and returned in safety without
its presence being spotted by the enemy. He
knew, too, that the bomb-rack had been full
when Ronnie and Beryl Gaselee had ascended,
and that it had been empty when they had
returned.</p>

<p>On the previous night Pryor had been up,
accompanied by his mechanic. They had come
in at daybreak, snatched three hours&#8217; sleep,
and were now out again overhauling the
machine.</p>

<p>As they were speaking, Beryl Gaselee, dainty
and fair-haired, in a cool, white cotton dress,
suddenly came up behind them exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Ronnie! Iris is waiting
breakfast patiently for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I really forgot, dear!&#8221; replied the young
airman. &#8220;Collins and I have been so busy
for the last hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>Together they crossed the lawn arm-in-arm to
the pleasant, old-world house.</p>

<p>When ten minutes later the pair sat down to
breakfast in the sunlit dining-room, the long
windows of which led out upon an ancient terrace
embowered with roses, Mrs. Remington came in,
greeting Ronald with the protest&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish, when you come in, you&#8217;d put your
silencer on your boots, Ronnie! You woke me
up just at four, and Toby started to bark.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>&#8220;By Jove! Did I? Lots of apologies! I&#8217;ll
creep about in my socks in future,&#8221; declared
the culprit, stooping to pat the miniature
&#8220;pom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did Sheppard give you the telephone
message?&#8221; Mrs. Remington asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. What message?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, one that came in the middle of the
night?&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment Sheppard, the old-fashioned
butler who had just entered the room, interrupted,
saying in his quiet way:</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen Mr. Pryor before, madam.&#8221;
Then turning to Ronnie, he said: &#8220;The telephone
rang at about a quarter to one. I answered it.
Somebody&mdash;a man&#8217;s voice&mdash;was speaking from
Liverpool. He wanted you, sir. But I said
you were out. He told me to give you a message,&#8221;
and he handed Ronnie a slip of paper upon which
were pencilled the words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>&#8220;Please tell Mr. Ronald Pryor that Mark Marx
has returned. He will be in London at the old
place at ten o&#8217;clock to-night.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>

<p>As Ronald Pryor&#8217;s eyes fell upon that message
all the light died from his face.</p>

<p>Beryl noticed it, and asked her lover whether
he had received bad news. He started. Then,
recovering himself instantly, he held his breath
for a second, and replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all, dear. It is only from a friend&mdash;a
man whom I believed had been killed, but who is
well and back again in England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be many such cases,&#8221; the fair-haired
girl remarked. &#8220;I heard of one the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
day when a man reported dead a year ago, and for
whom his widow was mourning, suddenly walked
into his own drawing-room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope his return was not unwelcome?&#8221; said
Ronnie with a laugh. &#8220;It would have been a
trifle awkward, for example, if the widow had
re-married in the meantime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, rather a queer situation&mdash;at least, for
the second husband,&#8221; declared Iris, who was some
five years Beryl&#8217;s senior, and the mother of two
pretty children.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did the person who spoke to you give any
name?&#8221; asked Pryor of the butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir. He would give no name. He simply
said that you would quite understand, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ronald Pryor did understand. Mark Marx
was back again in England! It seemed
incredible. But whose was that voice which in
the night had warned him from Liverpool?</p>

<p>He ate his breakfast wondering. Should he tell
Beryl? Should he reveal the whole curious truth
to her? No. If he did so, she might become
nervous and apprehensive. Why shake the
nerves of a woman who did such fine work in the
air? It would be best for him to keep his own
counsel. Therefore, before he rose from the
table, he had resolved to retain the secret of
Marx&#8217;s return.</p>

<p>After breakfast Ronald, having taken from
&#8220;The Hornet&#8221; the essential parts of his newly
invented silencer, which, by the way, he daily
expected would be adopted by the Government,
carried them back to the house and there locked
them in the big safe which he kept in his bedroom.</p>

<p>Then, later on, Beryl drove him to the station<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
where he took train to London, and travelled
down to his aeroplane factory, where, in secret,
several big battleplanes of &#8220;The Hornet&#8221; type
were being constructed.</p>

<p>It was a large, imposing place with many sheds
and workshops, occupying a considerable area.
The whole place was surrounded by a high wall,
and, beyond, a barbed-wire entanglement, for
the secrets of the work in progress were well
guarded by trusty, armed watchmen night and day.</p>

<p>Pryor was seated in his office chatting with Mr.
Woodhouse, the wide-awake and active manager,
about certain business matters, when he suddenly
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, it will be best to double all precautions
against any information leaking out from
here, and on no account to admit any strangers
upon any pretext whatever. Even if any fresh
Government viewer comes along he is not to enter
until you have verified his identity-pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; was Woodhouse&#8217;s reply. &#8220;But
why are we to be so very particular?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I have my own reasons. Without
doubt, our friend the enemy is extremely anxious
to obtain the secrets of &#8216;The Hornet,&#8217; and also
the silencer. And in these days we must run
no risks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, after a stroll through the sheds where a
hundred or so men were at work upon the various
parts of the new battleplane destined to &#8220;strafe&#8221;
the Huns, and clear the air of the Fokkers, the
easy-going but intrepid airman made his way
back to Pall Mall, where he ate an early dinner
alone in the big upstairs dining-room at the
Royal Automobile Club.</p>

<p>By half-past seven he had smoked the post-prandial
cigarette, swallowed a tiny glass of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Grand Marnier Cordon Rouge, and was strolling
back along Pall Mall towards Charing Cross.</p>

<p>At the corner of the Haymarket he hailed a
passing taxi, and drove out to Hammersmith to
a small, dingy house situated in a side-turning
off the busy King Street. There he dismissed
the conveyance, and entered the house with a
latch-key.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cranch!&#8221; he shouted when in the small,
close-smelling hall, having closed the door behind
him. &#8220;Cranch! Are you at home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo! Is that you, Mr. Pryor?&#8221; came a
cheery answer, when from the back room on the
ground-floor emerged a burly, close-shaven man
in his shirt-sleeves, for it was a hot, breathless
night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;m quite a stranger, am I not?&#8221;
laughed Pryor, following his host back into the
cheaply furnished sitting-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Cranch, I&#8217;m going out on a funny
expedition to-night,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want you to
fit me up with the proper togs for the Walworth
Road. You know the best rig-out. And I want
you to come with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, Mr. Pryor,&#8221; was his host&#8217;s reply.
John Cranch had done his twenty-five years in
the Criminal Investigation Department at
Scotland Yard as sergeant and inspector, and
now amplified his pension by doing private inquiry
work. He was &#8220;on the list&#8221; at the Yard, and to
persons who went to the police headquarters to
seek unofficial assistance his name was frequently
given as a very reliable officer.</p>

<p>The pair sat for some time in earnest consultation,
after which both ascended to a bedroom
above, where, in the cupboard, hung many suits
of clothes, from the rags of a tramp&mdash;with broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
boots to match&mdash;to the smart evening clothes of
the prosperous middle-aged <i>roué</i> who might be
seen at supper at the Savoy, or haunting the nightclubs
of London. Among them were the uniforms
of a postman, a railway-porter, with caps
belonging to the various companies, a fireman, a
private soldier, a lieutenant, a gas-inspector, a
tram-conductor, and other guises which ex-detective
John Cranch had, from time to time,
assumed.</p>

<p>Within half-an-hour the pair again descended,
and entering the sitting-room they presented quite
a different appearance.</p>

<p>Ronnie Pryor&#8217;s most intimate friend would
certainly not easily have recognised him. Even
Beryl Gaselee would have passed him by in the
street without a second glance, for his features
were altered; he wore a small moustache, and his
clothes were those of an East-end Jew. At the
same time Cranch was dressed as a hard-working
costermonger of the true Old Kent Road type.</p>

<p>Together they drove in a taxi across South
London to the railway-arch at Walworth Road
station, beneath which they alighted and, turning
to the right along the Camberwell Road, crossed
it and went leisurely into the Albany Road&mdash;that
long, straight thoroughfare of dingy old-fashioned
houses which were pleasant residences in the
&#8220;forties&#8221; when Camberwell was still a rural
village&mdash;the road which ran direct from Camberwell
Gate to the Old Kent Road.</p>

<p>Darkness had already fallen as the pair strolled
leisurely along until they passed a small house on
the left, close to the corner of Villa Street.</p>

<p>As they went by, their eyes took in every detail.
Not a large house, but rather superior to its neighbours,
it lay back behind a small garden and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
seemed closely shuttered and obscure. Nearly
opposite it Cranch&#8217;s sharp eyes espied a &#8220;To
Let&#8221; board upon a house, and he at once suggested
that if they hid behind the railing they could
watch the house of mystery in security.</p>

<p>This they did, and after a little man&oelig;uvring&mdash;for
there were many people passing in the vicinity&mdash;they
both crouched beneath a soot-laden lilac-bush,
which commanded full view of all who
went from and came to the dark house before
them.</p>

<p>As Ronnie crouched there in concealment one
thought alone kept running through his brain.
Truth to tell, he was much mystified as to the
identity of that mysterious person who, from
Liverpool, had given him warning.</p>

<p>Was it a trap? He had certainly not
overlooked such a contingency.</p>

<p>For over an hour and a half the two men
remained there, eagerly watching the diminishing
stream of foot-passengers until at last, coming up
from the Camberwell Road, Ronnie noticed a
man approaching.</p>

<p>For some seconds he kept his eye steadily upon
him, for the moon was now shining fitfully through
the clouds.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove! How curious!&#8221; he whispered to
his companion. &#8220;Why, that&#8217;s Knowles, one of
the mechanics at Hendon! I wonder what he&#8217;s
doing over here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ronnie was, of course, in ignorance&mdash;as was
also everyone at the Hendon Aerodrome&mdash;that
Henry Knowles, the hard-working, painstaking
mechanic, whose expert work it was to test
machines, was not really an Englishman as he
pretended to be, even though he could imitate
the Cockney tongue, but that his actual baptismal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
name was Hermann Klitz, and his place of birth
Coblenz, on the Rhine.</p>

<p>With wondering eyes the airman watched the
mechanic pass into the dark, silent house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very strange!&#8221; he remarked beneath his
breath. &#8220;Very strange indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>But his curiosity was increased by the arrival,
ten minutes later, of a rather short, middle-aged
man of distinctly burly build. The newcomer
hesitated for a few minutes, gazing about him
furtively, as though he feared being followed, and
then slipped through the gate up to the house, where
the door fell open, he being apparently expected.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see that man, Cranch?&#8221; asked
Pryor in a whisper. &#8220;That&#8217;s Germany&#8217;s great
spy&mdash;Mark Marx. He&#8217;s been in America for the
past ten months or so, and is now back here upon
some secret mission concerning our aircraft&mdash;upon
which he&#8217;s an expert.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re holding a council here&mdash;by the look
of it,&#8221; remarked the detective. &#8220;Five of them
have gone in&mdash;and why, look! Here comes
another&mdash;a lame man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Ronnie. &#8220;This secret place of
meeting is known to the spies of Germany as
&#8216;Number Three.&#8217; From here certain of the clever
activities of the invisible hand of Germany are
frequently directed, as from other centres;
Mark Marx is a clever adventurer who used to
be the assistant director of the enemy&#8217;s operations
in this country. Apparently he has returned
to London to resume his sinister activities against
us. He acts directly under the control of the head
of Germany&#8217;s secret service in this country,
that shrewd, clever, and influential person who
hides his identity beneath the official description
of &#8216;Number Seven.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>&#8220;Then &#8216;Number Three&#8217; is the headquarters
of &#8216;Number Seven&#8217;&mdash;eh!&#8221; asked the ex-detective
in a whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. That some devilish conspiracy is
now afoot is quite certain. Our duty is to discover
and to thwart it. I was secretly warned
that Mark Marx had returned, and now, knowing
that it is so, I must take adequate precautions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How shall you act?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not yet decided.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But can&#8217;t we endeavour to ascertain what
is in progress here to-night, Mr. Pryor?&#8221;
suggested Cranch.</p>

<p>Pryor and his companion kept vigilant watch
till far into the night when, about two o&#8217;clock
in the morning, a big closed motor-car suddenly
came along the road, pulling up a little distance
from the house. The driver, a tall, thin man,
alighted and waited for some moments, when the
two men, Marx and Klitz, <i>alias</i> Knowles, emerged
carrying between them a small but heavy leather
travelling trunk and, assisted by the driver,
placed this on top of the car. Then the two men
entered and drove rapidly away.</p>

<p>&#8220;That car may come again to-morrow night,&#8221;
remarked Pryor. &#8220;We must lay our plans to
follow it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next night, Pryor having ascertained the
identity of the friend who had warned him of
Mark Marx&#8217;s return to England, he and Cranch
were again at the same spot beneath the stunted
lilac-bush. Round the corner, in Villa Street,
at a little distance away stood Ronnie&#8217;s closed
car with Beryl Gaselee in charge, the latter
wearing the cap and dust-coat of a war-time
<i>chauffeuse</i>.</p>

<p>Hour after hour they waited until dawn broke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
But as no one came to that house known as
&#8220;Number Three,&#8221; they were compelled at last to
relinquish their vigilance.</p>

<p>For four nights in succession they kept the same
watch, Cranch having revealed his identity and
explained to the constable on duty that the car
was awaiting an expected friend.</p>

<p>On the fifth occasion, just about half-past one
in the morning, sure enough the big, dark-green
car drove up, and from it Marx alighted and
entered the enemy&#8217;s headquarters.</p>

<p>Presently Klitz and another man arrived on
foot, and they also entered. Subsequently
another small but heavy trunk was taken out
and placed in the car.</p>

<p>By this time Ronnie and his companion had
reached their own car, and while Cranch and
Beryl entered, Ronnie jumped up to the wheel
and started off. He first took a street that he
knew ran parallel with the Albany Road in the
direction the car had taken before and, after
going a little distance, he turned back into the
thoroughfare just in time to see a rear-lamp pass
rapidly. Quickly he increased his speed, and soon
satisfied himself that it was the car he intended
following.</p>

<p>They turned at last into the Old Kent Road,
and then on as far as a dark little place which
Ronnie knew as Kingsdown. Then, branching
to the right, keeping the red rear-light ever in
view, they went by the byways as far as
Meopham and on past Jenkin&#8217;s Court, through
some woods until suddenly the car turned into
a gateway and went across some open pastures.</p>

<p>Ronnie saw that he had not been noticed by
the driver, who was too intent upon his speed
and quite unsuspicious. Therefore he pulled up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
dead, waited for ten minutes or so, and then
flew past the gateway at top speed. For nearly
a mile he went, and at last came to a standstill
upon a long, steep slope with a copse on each side,
quite dark on account of the overhanging trees.</p>

<p>Having run the car to the side of the road they
alighted. Ronnie switched off the lamps, and
they walked noiselessly back on the grass by
the roadside and at length, having turned in at
the gateway, saw, in the dim light, a long, low-built
farmhouse with haystacks beside it and
big barns.</p>

<p>The throb of the car&#8217;s engine showed that the
Germans were probably only depositing the trunk,
and did not intend to remain.</p>

<p>The watchers, therefore, withdrew again into
the shadow of a narrow little wood close to the
house and there waited in patience. Their
expectations were realised a quarter of an hour
later when the two men emerged from the
modern-built farmhouse and drove away,
evidently on their return to London.</p>

<p>By their man&oelig;uvre Pryor became greatly
puzzled. He could not see why that trunk
had been transferred to that lonely farm in the
night hours.</p>

<p>After the car had disappeared they waited
in motionless silence for some time until, after
a whispered consultation, they ventured forth
again.</p>

<p>Cranch&#8217;s suggestion was to examine the place,
but unfortunately a collie was roaming about,
and as soon as they came forth from their place
of concealment the dog gave his alarm note.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ben!&#8221; cried a gruff, male voice in rebuke,
while at the same time a light showed in the upper
window of the farm.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>Meanwhile the trio of watchers remained
hidden in the shadow of a wall close to the
spacious farmyard until the dog had gone back.</p>

<p>Ronnie had resolved to leave the investigation
until the following day, therefore all three crept
back to the car and, after carefully noting the
exact spot and the silhouette of the trees, they
at last started off and presently finding a high
road, ran down into Wrotham, and on into the
long town of Tonbridge.</p>

<p>At the hotel their advent at such an early
hour was looked upon askance, but a well-concocted
story of a night journey and unfortunate
tyre trouble allayed any suspicions, and by seven
o&#8217;clock the three were seated at an ample breakfast
with home-cured ham and farmyard eggs.
Afterwards, for several hours, Beryl rested
while the airman and the detective wandered
about the little Kentish town discussing their
plans.</p>

<p>When, at eleven o&#8217;clock, Ronnie met Beryl
again downstairs, the trio went into one of the
sitting-rooms where they held secret council.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; exclaimed Ronnie, &#8220;my plan is this.
I&#8217;ll run back alone to the farm and stroll around
the place to reconnoitre and ascertain who lives
there. Without a doubt they are agents of
Germany, whoever they are, because it is a depôt
for those mysterious trunks from &#8216;Number
Three.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what they contain, dear?&#8221; Beryl
said, her face full of keenest interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall ascertain, never fear. But we must
remain patient, and work in strictest secrecy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Pryor, you can play the police game
as well as any of us,&#8221; declared Cranch, with a
light laugh.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>Therefore, a quarter of an hour later, Pryor
took the car and returning to a spot near the
farm&mdash;which he afterwards found was called Chandler&#8217;s
Farm&mdash;and running the car into a meadow,
left it while he went forward to reconnoitre.</p>

<p>As he approached, he noticed two men working
in a field close by, therefore he had to exercise
great care not to be detected. By a circuitous
route he at last approached the place, finding it,
in daylight, to be a very modern up-to-date
establishment&mdash;evidently the dairy farm of some
estate, for the outbuildings and barns were all
new, and of red brick, with corrugated iron roofs.</p>

<p>The farmhouse itself was a big, pleasant place
situated on a hill, surrounded by a large, well-kept
flower-garden, and commanding a wide
view across Kent towards the Thames Estuary
and the coast.</p>

<p>And as Ronnie crept along the belt of trees,
his shrewd gaze taking in everything, there
passed from the house across the farmyard a
tall man in mechanic&#8217;s blue overalls. He walked
a trifle lame, and by his gait Pryor felt certain
that he was one of the men who had been present
at that mysterious house called &#8220;Number Three&#8221;
a few nights before.</p>

<p>But why should he wear mechanic&#8217;s overalls,
unless he attended to some agricultural machinery
at work on the farm?</p>

<p>Only half-satisfied with the result of his
observations, Ronnie returned at length to his
companions, when it was resolved to set watch
both at Albany Road and at Chandler&#8217;s Farm.
With that object Pryor later that day telegraphed
to Collins calling him to London from Harbury,
and after meeting him introduced him to the
ex-detective.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>Then that night the two men went to Albany
Road, while Ronnie and Beryl returned in the
car back into Kent, where soon after ten o&#8217;clock
they were hiding on the edge of the little wood
whence there was afforded a good view of the
approach to the lonely farm.</p>

<p>Time passed very slowly; they dared not speak
above a whisper. The night was dull and overcast,
with threatening rain, but all was silent
save for the howling of a dog at intervals and
the striking of a distant church clock.</p>

<p>Far across the valley in the darkness of the
sky behind the hill could be seen the flicker
of an anti-aircraft searchlight somewhere in the
far distance, in readiness for any aerial raid on
the part of the Huns.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t think what can be in progress here,
Beryl,&#8221; Ronnie was whispering. &#8220;What, I
wonder, do those trunks contain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what we must discover, dear,&#8221; was
the girl&#8217;s soft reply as, in the darkness, his strong
hand closed over hers and he drew her fondly
to his breast.</p>

<p>A dim light still showed in one of the lower
windows of the farmhouse, though it was now
long past midnight.</p>

<p>Was the arrival of someone expected? It
certainly seemed so, because just at two o&#8217;clock
the door opened and the form of the lame man
became silhouetted against the light. For a
moment he came forth and peered into the
darkness. Then he re-entered and ten minutes
later the light, extinguished below, reappeared
at one of the bedroom windows, showing that the
inmate had retired.</p>

<p>For six nights the same ceaseless vigil was kept,
but without anything abnormal transpiring. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
man Marx had not again visited the mysterious
house in Albany Road, yet the fact that the
obscured light showed nightly in the window of
Chandler&#8217;s Farm, made it apparent that some
midnight visitor was expected. For that reason
alone Ronnie did not relinquish his vigilance.</p>

<p>One night he was creeping with Beryl towards
the spot where they spent so many silent hours,
and had taken a shorter cut across the corner
of a big grass-field when, of a sudden, his well-beloved
stumbled and almost fell. Afterwards,
on groping about, he discovered an insulated
electric wire lying along the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s curious,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Is this a
telephone, I wonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>Fearing to switch on his torch, he felt by the
touch that it was a twin wire twisted very much
like a telephone-lead.</p>

<p>At the same moment, as they stood together
in the corner of the field, Beryl sniffed,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;What a very strong smell of petrol!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her lover held his nose in the air, and declared
that he, too, could detect it, the two discoveries
puzzling them considerably. Indeed, in the
succeeding hours as they watched together in
silence, both tried to account for the existence
of that secret twisted wire. Whence did it come,
and whither did it lead?</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll investigate it as soon as it gets light,&#8221;
Ronnie declared.</p>

<p>Just before two o&#8217;clock the silence was broken
by the distant hum of an aeroplane. Both
detected it at the same instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo! One of our boys doing a night
stunt?&#8221; remarked Ronnie, straining his eyes
into the darkness, but failing to see the oncoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
machine. Away across the hills a long, white
beam began to search the sky and, having found
the machine and revealed the rings upon it,
at once shut off again.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as it approached, the door of
Chandler&#8217;s Farm was opened by the tall, lame
man, who stood outside until the machine, by
its noise, was almost over them. Then to the
amazement of the watchers, four points of light
suddenly appeared at the corners of the grass-field
on their left.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove! Why, he&#8217;s coming down!&#8221; cried
Ronnie astounded. &#8220;There was petrol placed
at each corner yonder, and it&#8217;s simultaneously
been ignited by means of the electric wire to
show him his landing-place! It&#8217;s an enemy
machine got up to look like one of ours! This
<i>is</i> a discovery!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it is!&#8221; gasped Beryl, standing at her
lover&#8217;s side, listening to the aeroplane, unseen
in the darkness, as it hovered around the farm
and slowly descended.</p>

<p>The man at the farm had brought out a blue
lamp and was showing it upward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; exclaimed Pryor. &#8220;He&#8217;s telling
him the direction of the wind&mdash;a pretty cute
arrangement, and no mistake!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lower and lower came the mysterious aeroplane
until it skimmed the tops of the trees in the wood
in which they stood, then, making a tour of the
field, it at last came lightly to earth within the
square marked by the little cups of burning petrol.</p>

<p>The pilot stopped his engine, the four lights
burnt dim and went out one after the other, and
the lame man, hurrying down, gave a low whistle
which was immediately answered.</p>

<p>Then, on their way back to the farm, the pair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
passed close to where the watchers were hidden,
and in the silence the latter could distinctly
hear them speaking&mdash;eagerly and excitedly in
German!</p>

<p>Beryl and Ronnie watched there until dawn,
when they saw the two men wheel the monoplane,
disguised as British with rings upon it, into the
long shed at the bottom of the meadow, the door
of which the lame man afterwards securely locked.</p>

<p>An hour later Pryor was speaking on the telephone
with Cranch in London, telling him what
they had discovered. Soon after midday Beryl
and Ronnie were back at Harbury, where in the
library window they stood in consultation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Beryl,&#8221; the keen-faced young man
said, &#8220;as that machine has crossed from Belgium,
it is undoubtedly going back again. If so,
it will take something with it&mdash;something which
no doubt the enemy wants to send out of the
country by secret means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With that I quite agree, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. Then there&#8217;s no time to be lost,&#8221;
her lover said, poring over a map. &#8220;We&#8217;ll fly
over to Chandler&#8217;s Farm this afternoon, come
down near Fawkham, and put the &#8217;bus away
till to-night. Then we&#8217;ll see what happens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll probably fly back to-night,&#8221; the girl
suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly what I expect. I&#8217;ve told
Collins and Cranch to meet us there.&#8221;</p>

<p>An hour later the great battleplane, &#8220;The
Hornet,&#8221; Ronnie at the joy-stick, with Beryl
in air-woman&#8217;s clothes and goggles strapped in
the observer&#8217;s seat, rose with a roar from the big
meadow at Harbury and, ascending to an altitude
of about ten thousand feet, struck away due
south across the patchwork of brown fields and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
green meadows, with their tiny clusters of houses
and white puffs of smoke all blowing in the same
direction&mdash;the usual panorama of rural England,
with its straight lines of rails and winding roads,
as seen from the air.</p>

<p>The roar of the powerful twin engines was such
that they found conversation impossible, but
Beryl, practised pilot that she was, soon recognised
the town over which they were flying.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the Thames, half-hidden in
mist and winding like a ribbon, came into view
far below them. This served as guide, for Ronnie
kept over the river for some time, at the end of
which both recognised three church spires and
knew that the most distant one was that of
Fawkham, where presently they came down in
a field about half-way between the station and
the village, creating considerable sensation among
the cottagers in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Collins, who was awaiting them near the station,
soon arrived on foot to render them assistance,
the &#8217;bus being eventually put beneath a convenient
shed used for the shacking of hay.</p>

<p>Ronnie had not used the silencer, fearing to
create undue excitement among the anti-aircraft
boys, many of whom had, of course, watched
the machine&#8217;s flight at various points, examining
it through glasses and being reassured by its
painted rings.</p>

<p>Until night fell the lovers remained at
Fawkham, taking their evening meal in a small
inn there, and wondering what Cranch had seen
during the daylight vigil he had kept since noon.
Collins had left them in order to go on ahead.</p>

<p>As dusk deepened into night both Pryor and
his well-beloved grew more excited. The discovery
they had made was certainly an amazing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
one, but the intentions of the enemy were still
enveloped in mystery.</p>

<p>That something desperate was to be attempted
was, however, quite plain.</p>

<p>In eagerness they remained until night had
fallen completely, then, leaving the inn, they
returned to the farmer&#8217;s shed, and, wheeling
forth the powerful machine, got in and, having
bidden the astonished farmer good-night, Ronnie
put on the silencer, started the engines, and next
moment, rising almost noiselessly, made a wide
circle in the air. Taking his bearings with some
difficulty, he headed for a small, open common,
which they both knew well, situated about a
quarter of a mile from Chandler&#8217;s Farm.</p>

<p>There, with hardly any noise, they made
a safe descent. Scarcely had the pilot switched
off the engines, when the faithful Collins appeared
with the news that Marx and the man Knowles
had arrived from London in the car at seven
o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>Presently, when Collins had been left in charge
of the &#8217;bus, and Ronnie and Beryl had stolen
up to where Cranch was waiting, the latter whispered
that Marx and Knowles had both accompanied
the German pilot down to the shed wherein
the disguised machine was reposing. &#8220;They&#8217;re
all three down there now,&#8221; added the ex-detective.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did they bring anything in the car?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Half-a-dozen cans of petrol. They&#8217;ve
just taken them down to the shed.&#8221;</p>

<p>And even as he replied they could hear the
voices of the three returning. They were conversing
merrily in German.</p>

<p>Another long, watchful hour went by, and the
darkness increased.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he&#8217;s going over to Belgium it will take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
him about an hour and three-quarters to reach
Zeebrugge&mdash;for that&#8217;s where he probably came
from,&#8221; remarked the expert Pryor. &#8220;It&#8217;s light
now at four, so he&#8217;ll go up before two, or not at
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He would hardly risk being caught at sea in
daylight,&#8221; declared Beryl.</p>

<p>Then, for a long time, there was silence, the
eyes of all three being fixed upon the door of the
farm until, of a sudden, it opened and the lame
man and the enemy pilot were seen to emerge
carrying between them one of the old leather
trunks that had been brought from London.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo! They&#8217;re going to take it across by
air!&#8221; cried Pryor. &#8220;It must contain something
which ought to remain in this country!&#8221;</p>

<p>They watched the trunk being carried in silence
away into the darkness to the shed. Then
presently the two men returned and brought
out the second trunk, which they carried to the
same spot as the first.</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; remarked Ronnie, beneath his breath.
&#8220;A devilish clever game&mdash;no doubt!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, instructing Cranch to remain and watch,
he led Beryl back to where &#8220;The Hornet&#8221; stood.</p>

<p>Into the observer&#8217;s seat he strapped the girl,
and, hopping in himself, whispered to Collins
to get all ready.</p>

<p>The engine was started; but it made no sound
greater than a silent motor-car when standing.</p>

<p>Ronnie and Beryl strained their ears to listen
for the sound of the engine of the enemy &#8217;plane.</p>

<p>Those moments were full of breathless tension
and excitement. &#8220;The Hornet&#8221; was waiting
to rise.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a loud sound of uneven
motor explosions in the direction of the farm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
The engine was firing badly. In a few moments,
however, it was rectified, and the loud and increasing
hum told Ronnie that the enemy had risen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand clear,&#8221; he shouted to Collins, and then,
as he pulled over the lever, &#8220;The Hornet&#8221; dashed
forward and was soon rising rapidly, but in silence.</p>

<p>So dark was it that he could not distinguish
the enemy. Yet, heading for the coast, as he
knew that was the direction the German had
taken, he rose higher and higher until five minutes
later Beryl, at his orders, suddenly switched on
the searchlight and swept around below them.</p>

<p>At first they could distinguish nothing, yet from
the direction of the humming they knew it must
be below them.</p>

<p>Two minutes later Ronnie&#8217;s quick eyes saw it
in front of them, but a hundred feet or so nearer
the ground.</p>

<p>The enemy pilot, alarmed by the unexpected
searchlight in the air, suddenly rose, but Ronnie
was too quick for him and rose also, at the same
time rapidly overhauling him.</p>

<p>Beryl, holding her breath, kept the searchlight
with difficulty upon him as gradually &#8220;The
Hornet&#8221; drew over directly above him.</p>

<p>Quick as lightning Ronnie touched a button.</p>

<p>There was a loud swish of air, followed a second
later by a dull, heavy explosion in the valley
far below.</p>

<p>The bomb had missed!</p>

<p>The enemy was still rising, and from him came
the quick rattle of a machine-gun, followed by
a shower of bullets from below.</p>

<p>Ronnie Pryor set his teeth hard, and as he
again touched the button, exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Take that, then!&#8221;</p>

<p>Next second a bright flash lit up the rural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
landscape, followed by a terrific explosion, the
concussion of which caused &#8220;The Hornet&#8221; to
stagger, reel, and side-slip, while the enemy aeroplane
was seen falling to earth a huge mass of
blood-red flame.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the following day the evening papers
reported the finding of a mysterious wrecked
and burnt-out aeroplane &#8220;somewhere in Kent.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pilot had been burnt out of all recognition,
but among the wreckage there had been
discovered, it was said, some metal fittings
believed to be the principal parts of some unknown
machine-gun.</p>

<p>Only Ronald Pryor and Beryl Gaselee knew
the actual truth, namely, that the enemy&#8217;s
secret agents, at Marx&#8217;s incentive, had stolen,
the essential parts of a newly-invented machine-gun,
and that these were being conveyed by air
to within the German lines, when the clever plot
was fortunately frustrated by &#8220;The Hornet.&#8221;</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>THE SHABBY STRANGER.</small></h2></div>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Ronald</span> has wired that he can&#8217;t get back here
till to-night, so I shall fly &#8216;The Hornet&#8217; over to
Sleaford to see Rose,&#8221; remarked Beryl to her
sister Iris, as they sat together at breakfast at
Harbury one warm August morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps Ronald might object,&#8221; remarked
Mrs. Remington, who was always averse from
her sister making ascents alone upon &#8220;The
Hornet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Ronnie won&#8217;t object! Besides, he always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
says that I can fly just as well as any
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But do be careful, won&#8217;t you, Beryl?&#8221;
urged her sister. &#8220;Is the weather really in a
condition for making such a flight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfect. I&#8217;ve just been looking at the
barometer. It is quite steady, and I shall have
an excellent wind back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought Ronald intended to go up on
patrol-duty to-night. Last night was very dark&mdash;just
the conditions for another Zepp raid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect he will,&#8221; replied Beryl. &#8220;He told
me that he intended to patrol the coast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, if you go, you really will be careful,
won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Beryl laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, when once up there is not so much
danger in the air as there is in walking along a
London street,&#8221; she declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;So Ronnie always says, but I rather doubt
the statement,&#8221; Iris replied. &#8220;Personally, I
prefer <i>terra firma</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Breakfast ended, Beryl brushed her little black
pom, one of her daily duties, and then, going
to her room, changed her dress, putting on a warm
jersey and a pair of workmanlike trousers, and
over them a windproof flying suit with leather
cap tied beneath her chin, a garb which gave her
a very masculine appearance.</p>

<p>Very soon she arrived at &#8220;The Hornet Nest,&#8221;
and, at her directions, Collins brought out
the great biplane and began to run the engine,
which Beryl watched with critical eye. Then,
climbing into the pilot&#8217;s seat, she began to
manipulate the levers to reassure herself that
all the controls were in order.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>&#8220;Beautiful morning for a flip, miss!&#8221;
remarked the mechanic in brown overalls. &#8220;Are
you going up alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Collins. I&#8217;m going to visit my youngest
sister at Sleaford, in Lincolnshire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll take the bombs out,&#8221; he said, and
at once removed the six powerful bombs from the
rack, the projectiles intended for the destruction
of Zeppelins. He also dismounted the quick-firing
gun.</p>

<p>For some time Beryl did not appear entirely
satisfied with the throb of the engines, but at last
Collins adjusted them until they were running
perfectly.</p>

<p>Within himself Collins was averse from allowing
the girl to fly such a powerful machine, knowing
how easily, with such a big engine-power, the
biplane might get the upper hand of her. But
as she had made ascents alone in it several times
before, it was not for him to raise any objection.</p>

<p>Having consulted her map she arranged it
inside its waterproof cover, looked around at the
instruments set before her, and then strapped
herself into the seat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the engines had been humming
loudly.</p>

<p>Suddenly she motioned to Collins to stand aside,
and then, pulling over one of the levers,
she ran along the grass for a short distance and
rose gracefully in a long spiral, round and round
over the Harbury woods, until the altimeter
showed a height of five thousand feet.</p>

<p>Then she studied her map, took her bearings,
and, drawing on her ample gauntlet gloves, for
it became chilly, she followed a straight line of
railway leading due north through Suffolk and
Norfolk.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>The sky was cloudless, with a slight head-wind.
On her right, away in the misty distance, lay
the North Sea, whence came a fresh breeze,
invigorating after the stifling August morning
on land. Deep below she identified villages
and towns. Some of the latter were only indicated
by palls of smoke, the wind on land being
insufficient to disperse them. And over all the grey-green
landscape was a strange flatness, for,
viewed from above, the country has no contours.
It is just a series of grey, green, and brown patchwork
with white, snaky lines, denoting roads, and
long, grey lines, sometimes disappearing and then
reappearing, marking railways and their tunnels;
while here and there comes a glint of sunshine
upon a river or canal. In the ears there is only
the deafening roar of petrol-driven machinery.</p>

<p>Once or twice, through the grey haze which
always rises from the earth on a hot morning,
Beryl saw the blue line of the sea&mdash;that sea so
zealously guarded by Britain&#8217;s Navy. Then she
flew steadily north to the flat fens.</p>

<p>From below, her coming was signalled at several
points, and at more than one air-station glasses
were levelled at her. But the tri-coloured rings
upon the wings reassured our anti-aircraft boys
and, though they recognised the machine as one
of unusual model, they allowed her to pass, for
it was well-known that there were many
experimental machines in the air.</p>

<p>Beryl had sought and found upon her map
the Great Northern main line, and had followed
it from Huntingdon to Peterborough. Afterwards,
still following the railway, she went for
many miles until, of a sudden, close by a small town
which the map told her was called Bourne, in Lincolnshire,
her engines showed signs of slackening.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>Something was amiss. Her quick ear told her
so. A number of misfires occurred. She pulled
over another lever, but the result she expected
was not apparent. It was annoying that being
so near Sleaford she had met with engine trouble&mdash;for
trouble there undoubtedly was.</p>

<p>At that moment she was flying at fully ten
thousand feet, the normal height for a &#8220;non-stop
run.&#8221; Without being at all flurried she
decided that it would be judicious to plane down
to earth; therefore, putting &#8220;The Hornet&#8217;s&#8221;
nose to the wind, she turned slightly eastward,
and, as she came down, decided to land upon a
wide expanse of brown-green ground&mdash;which
very soon she distinguished as a piece of flat,
rich fenland, in which potatoes were growing.</p>

<p>At last she touched the earth and made a
dexterous landing.</p>

<p>At that moment, to her great surprise, she
became aware of a second machine in the vicinity.
She heard a low droning like that of a big bumblebee,
and on looking up saw an Army monoplane
coming down swiftly in her direction.</p>

<p>Indeed, its pilot brought it to earth within
a few hundred yards of where she had landed.
Then, springing out, he came across to where
she stood.</p>

<p>On approaching her he appeared to be greatly
surprised that the big biplane had been flown by
a woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw you were in trouble,&#8221; explained the
pilot, a tall, good-looking lieutenant of the Royal
Flying Corps, who spoke with a slight American
accent, &#8220;so I came down to see if I could give you
any assistance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is most awfully kind of you,&#8221; Beryl replied,
pulling off her thick gloves. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
it is really very much. I&#8217;ve had the same trouble
before. She&#8217;s a new &#8217;bus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I see,&#8221; replied the stranger, examining
&#8220;The Hornet&#8221; with critical eye. &#8220;And she&#8217;s
very fast, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When did you first see me?&#8221; she asked
with curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were passing over Huntingdon. I had
come across to the railway from the Great North
Road which I had followed up from London.
I&#8217;m on my way to Hull.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I had no idea you were behind me!&#8221;
laughed the girl merrily. The air-pilot with the
silver wings upon his breast seemed a particularly
nice man, and it showed a good <i>esprit de corps</i> to
have descended in order to offer assistance to
another man, as he had no doubt believed the
pilot to be.</p>

<p>Without further parley, he set to work to help
her in readjusting her engine, and in doing so quickly
betrayed his expert knowledge of aeroplane-engines.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have only a few miles to go&mdash;to Sleaford.
My sister lives just outside the town, and there
is a splendid landing-place in her husband&#8217;s
grounds,&#8221; Beryl explained, when at last the
engine ran smoothly again.</p>

<p>It was but natural that the good-looking
lieutenant should appear inquisitive regarding
the new machine. His expert eye showed him
the unusual power of the twin engines, and he
expressed much surprise at several new inventions
that had been introduced.</p>

<p>He told her that he had been flying for seven
months at the Front, and had been sent home for
a rest. He had flown from Farnborough that
morning and was making a &#8220;non-stop&#8221; to the
Humber.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>Many were the questions he put to Beryl
regarding &#8220;The Hornet.&#8221; So many and so
pressing were his queries that presently she
became seized by distrust&mdash;why, she could not
exactly decide.</p>

<p>The air-pilot naturally inquired as to the
biplane&#8217;s constructor, but all Beryl would say
was:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not mine. It belongs to a friend of
mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A gentleman friend, of course?&#8221; he remarked,
with a mischievous laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course! He himself invented it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A splendid defence against Zeppelins,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I see she can carry ten bombs, a searchlight,
and a Lewis gun. All are wanted against
the Kaiser&#8217;s infernal baby-killers,&#8221; he added,
laughing.</p>

<p>Then, having thoroughly examined &#8220;The
Hornet,&#8221; the courteous lieutenant of the Royal
Flying Corps stood by until she had again risen
in the air, waved her gloved hand in farewell,
made a circle over the field, and then headed
away for Sleaford.</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; grunted the flying-man as he stood
watching her disappear. &#8220;Foiled again! She&#8217;s
left that new silencer of hers at home! That
girl is no fool&mdash;neither is Ronald Pryor. Though
I waited for her in Bury St. Edmunds and followed
her up here, I am just about as wise regarding
&#8216;The Hornet&#8217; as I was before I started.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a few moments he stood watching the
machine as it soared higher and higher against
the cloudless summer sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! A very pretty girl&mdash;but very clever&mdash;devilishly
clever!&#8221; he muttered to himself.
&#8220;Just my luck! If only she had had that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
silencer I would have silenced her, and taken it
away with me. However, we are not yet defeated.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>About a week later Ronald Pryor and Beryl
were lunching together in the grill-room of a
West End hotel, which was one of their favourite
meeting-places, when suddenly the girl bent over
to her lover and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s the man, Ronnie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The nice Flying Corps officer whom I met
near Bourne the other day. You&#8217;ll see him, sitting
in the corner yonder alone&mdash;reading the paper,&#8221;
she replied. &#8220;Don&#8217;t look for a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think you&#8217;ve made a mistake,
dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I feel positive I haven&#8217;t,&#8221; was the girl&#8217;s
reply.</p>

<p>That morning Ronald Pryor, accompanied
by Beryl, had made a flight in &#8220;The Hornet&#8221;
from Harbury to the Essex coast and back, and
they had just arrived in town by train. The
renowned Zepp-hunter was in a light grey suit,
while Beryl, becomingly dressed, was in a coat
and skirt of navy blue gaberdine trimmed with
broad black silk braid.</p>

<p>A few moments after Beryl had spoken, her
lover turned suddenly, as though to survey
the room in search of someone he knew; his
gaze met that of the solitary man eating his
lunch leisurely in the corner and apparently,
until that moment, absorbed in a newspaper.
The stranger was good-looking, aged about
thirty, thin, rather narrow-faced, with a pair
of sharp steel-grey eyes, and a small dark moustache.
His shoulders were square, and his
appearance somewhat dandified. In his black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
cravat he wore an unusually fine diamond, and
his hands were white and well-kept.</p>

<p>Apparently he was a man of leisure, and was
entirely uninterested in those about him, for,
after a sharp glance of inquiry at Ronald, he
continued reading his paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you quite sure you&#8217;ve made no
mistake?&#8221; inquired Pryor of his companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Positive, my dear Ronald. That&#8217;s the man
whom I met in the uniform of the Royal Flying
Corps, and who was so kind to me. No doubt,
he doesn&#8217;t recognise me in these clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why isn&#8217;t he in uniform now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he has leave to wear <i>civvies</i>,&#8221; she
replied. &#8220;There are so many curious regulations
and exemptions nowadays.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though the stranger&#8217;s eyes had met those of
Beryl there had been no sign of recognition.
Hence she soon began to share Ronald&#8217;s doubt
as to whether he was really the same person
who had descended in that potato field in Lincolnshire,
and had so gallantly assisted her in
her trouble.</p>

<p>Ronald and his well-beloved, having finished
their luncheon, rose and drove together in a taxi
over to Waterloo, the former being due to visit
his works at Weybridge, where he had an
appointment with one of the Government
Inspectors.</p>

<p>As soon as they had passed out of the restaurant
the man who sat alone tossed his paper aside,
paid his bill, and left.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he entered a suite of chambers
in Ryder Street, where an elderly, rather staid-looking
grey-haired man rose to greet him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;What news?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing much&mdash;except that Pryor is flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
to-night on patrol work,&#8221; replied the other in
German.</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m, that means that he will have the new
silencer upon his machine!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said the man who had displayed
the silver wings of the Royal Flying Corps, though
he had no right whatever to them. &#8220;By day
&#8216;The Hornet&#8217; never carries the silencer. I
proved that when I assisted the girl in Lincolnshire.
We can only secure it by night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that is a little difficult&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;a trifle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then how do you intend to act, my dear
Leffner.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man addressed shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have an idea,&#8221; was his reply. &#8220;But I
do not yet know if it is feasible until I make
further observations and inquiries.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You anticipate success? Good!&#8221; the elder
man replied in satisfaction. &#8220;Think of all it
means to us. Only to-day I have received another
very urgent request from our good friend, Mr.
J&mdash;&mdash;; a request for the full details of the construction
of &#8216;The Hornet.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have most of them,&#8221; replied the man
addressed as Leffner.</p>

<p>&#8220;But not the secret of the silencer. That seems
to be well guarded, does it not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very well guarded,&#8221; Leffner admitted.
&#8220;But I view the future with considerable confidence
because the girl flies the machine alone, and&mdash;well,&#8221;
he laughed&mdash;&#8220;strange and unaccountable
accidents happen to aeroplanes sometimes!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A few days later, soon after noon, a narrow-faced
man, with shifty eyes, carrying a small,
well-worn leather bag, entered the old King&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Head Inn in Harbury village and, seating himself
in the bar, mopped his brow with his handkerchief.
The mile walk from the nearest station
had been a hot one along a dusty, shadeless road,
and when Jane Joyce, the landlady&#8217;s daughter,
appeared, the shabby traveller ordered a pint
of ale, which he drank almost at one draught.</p>

<p>Then, lighting his pipe, he began to chat with
Jane, having, as a preliminary, ordered some
luncheon. By this man&oelig;uvre he had loosened
the young woman&#8217;s tongue, and she was soon
gossiping about the village and those who lived
there.</p>

<p>The wayfarer asked many questions; as excuse,
he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The reason I want to know is because I
travel in jewellery, and I daresay there are a
lot of people about here whom I might call upon.
I come from Birmingham, and I&#8217;m usually in
this district four times a year, though I&#8217;ve never
been in Harbury before. My name is George
Bean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s not many people here who buy
jewellery,&#8221; replied the landlady&#8217;s daughter.
&#8220;Farming is so bad just now, and the war has
affected things a lot here. But why don&#8217;t you
go up and see Mrs. Remington, at Harbury Court?
They&#8217;ve got lots of money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Who are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Captain Remington is a prisoner in
Germany, but Mrs. Remington is still at home.
She has her sister, Miss Beryl Gaselee, staying
with her. Perhaps you&#8217;ve heard of her. She&#8217;s a
great flying-woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; replied the stranger. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen
things about her in the papers. Does she fly
much?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>&#8220;A good deal. Mr. Ronald Pryor, to whom
she&#8217;s engaged, invented her machine; he calls
it &#8216;The Hornet,&#8217; and he keeps it here&mdash;in a
corrugated iron shed in the park, close to the
house!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How interesting!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. And the pair often go up at nights,&#8221;
went on the young woman. &#8220;Mother and I
frequently hear them passing over the house in
the darkness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you always hear them go up?&#8221; asked
the stranger suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not always. They go over sometimes
without making a sound.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is at night, I suppose? In the day you
can always hear them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Always.&#8221;</p>

<p>The traveller in Birmingham jewellery remained
silent for a few minutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose they have a mechanic there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;a Mr. Collins. He comes in sometimes
with Mr. Sheppard, the butler. He was butler to
the Colonel&#8217;s old father, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And this Mr. Collins lives at the house, I
suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. He sleeps in the place where the new
aeroplane is kept.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Bean smiled, but made no comment.
Knowledge of that fact was, to him, important.
He lit another pipe, and, while Miss Joyce went
away to lay the table for his lunch in the adjoining
room, he stretched his legs and thought deeply.</p>

<p>Hans Leffner, <i>alias</i> George Bean, was the son
of a German who, forty years before, had emigrated
from Hamburg to Boston. Born in
America he was, nevertheless, a true son of the
Fatherland. He had been educated in Germany,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and returned to Boston about a year before
war broke out.</p>

<p>Suddenly he had been called up for confidential
service, and within a month had found himself
despatched to London, the bearer of an American
passport in the name of Henry Lane, commercial
traveller, of St. Louis. Upon a dozen different
secret matters he had been employed, until knowledge
of the existence of &#8220;The Hornet&#8221; having
reached the spy-bureau in Berlin, he received
certain secret instructions which he was carrying
out to the letter.</p>

<p>Hans Leffner had been taught at his mother&#8217;s
knee to hate England, and he hated it with a most
deadly hatred. He was a clever and daring spy,
as his masquerade in the Royal Flying Corps
uniform clearly proved; moreover, he was an aviation
expert who had once held a post of under-director
in &#8220;Uncle&#8221; Zeppelin&#8217;s aircraft factory.</p>

<p>For some weeks he had dogged the footsteps
of Ronald and Beryl, and they, happy in each
other&#8217;s affection, had been quite ignorant of how
the wandering American had been unduly
attracted towards them.</p>

<p>The landlady of the King&#8217;s Head&mdash;that long,
thatched, old-world house over which for fifty
years her husband had ruled as landlord&mdash;had
no suspicion that the jeweller&#8217;s traveller was
anything but an Englishman from Birmingham.
He spoke English well, and had no appearance
of the Teuton.</p>

<p>Mr. Bean ate his chop alone, waited on by
Jane, who, finding him affable, imparted to him
all the information she knew regarding Harbury
Court and its inmates.</p>

<p>At half-past two the traveller, taking his bag,
set out on a tour of the village in an endeavour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
to dispose of some of his samples. His appearance
was much changed, and he bore but little resemblance
to the pilot of the Royal Flying Corps
who had descended near Bourne. He looked
much older, and walked wearily, with a decided
stoop.</p>

<p>At house after house in the long village street
he called, disguising his intentions most perfectly.
At more than one cottage he was allowed to
exhibit his wares, and at the shop of the village
baker the daughter in charge purchased a little
brooch for five shillings. Its cost price was thirty
shillings, but Mr. Bean wanted to effect a sale
and, by so doing, appear to be carrying on a
legitimate business.</p>

<p>By six o&#8217;clock he was back again at the King&#8217;s
Head, having called upon most of the inhabitants
of Harbury. He had, indeed, been up to the
Court, and not only had he shown his samples
to the maids, but he had taken two orders for
rings to be sent on approval.</p>

<p>Incidentally he had passed &#8220;The Hornet&#8217;s&#8221;
nest, and had seen the machine in the meadow
outside, ready for the night flight. As a
simple, hard-working, travel-stained dealer in
cheap jewellery nobody had suspected him of
enemy intentions. But he had laid his plans
very carefully, and his observations round
&#8220;The Hornet&#8217;s&#8221; nest had told him much.</p>

<p>To Mrs. Joyce he declared that he was very
tired and, in consequence, had decided to remain
the night. So he was shown up stairs that were
narrow to a low-ceilinged room where the bed-stead
was one that had been there since the days
of Queen Anne. The chintzes were bright and
clean, but the candle in its brass candlestick
was a survival of an age long forgotten.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>At ten o&#8217;clock he retired to bed, declaring himself
very fatigued, but on going to his room he threw
open the old-fashioned, latticed window, and
listened. The night was very dark, but quite
calm&mdash;just the night for an air raid from the
enemy shore.</p>

<p>Having blown out his candle he sat down,
alert at any sound. After nearly an hour, Mrs.
Joyce and her daughter having retired to bed,
he suddenly detected a slight swish in the air,
quite distinct from the well-known hum of the
usual aeroplane. It was a low sound, rising at
one moment and lost the next. &#8220;The Hornet&#8221;
had passed over the inn so quietly that it would
not awaken the lightest sleeper.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; he exclaimed aloud to himself.
&#8220;That silencer is, indeed wonderful!&#8221;</p>

<p>With the greatest caution he opened his door
and, creeping down on tiptoe, was soon outside
in the village street; keeping beneath the deep
shadows, he went forward on the road which led
up the hill to the long belt of trees near
which had been erected the corrugated iron
shed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ronald, accompanied by Beryl, had
ascended higher and higher in the darkness.
Ronnie had swung the machine into the wind,
and they were climbing, climbing straight into
the dark vault above. Below were twinkling
shaded lights, some the red and green signal
lights of railways. Beryl could see dimly the
horizon of the world, and used as she was to it, she
realised how amazing it was to look down upon
Mother Earth. By day, when one is flying, the
sky does not rise and meet in a great arch overhead,
but, like a huge bowl, the sky seems to pass
over and incircle the earth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>They were flying due east by the dimly lit
compass at five thousand feet, heading straight
for the Essex coast.</p>

<p>&#8220;We may possibly have visitors from Belgium
to-night,&#8221; laughed Ronnie, as he turned to his
well-beloved. &#8220;But look! Why&mdash;we are already
over the sea!&#8221;</p>

<p>Beryl, gazing down, saw below a tiny light
twinkling out a message in Morse, answered by
another light not far distant. Two ships were
signalling. Then Ronnie made a wide circle in
that limitless void which obliterated the meeting
point of earth and sea.</p>

<p>The long white beam of a searchlight sweeping
slowly seaward, turned back inland and followed
them until it picked up &#8220;The Hornet,&#8221; Ronnie
banking suddenly to show the tri-coloured circles
upon his wings.</p>

<p>Afterwards he again consulted his compass and
struck due south, following the coast-line over
Harwich and round to the Thames estuary.</p>

<p>&#8220;No luck to-night, dearest!&#8221; laughed Ronnie.
&#8220;The barometer is too low for our friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;Let us get back!&#8221;
And Ronnie once more circled his machine very
prettily, showing perfect mastery over it, as he
came down lower and lower until, when passing
over Felixstowe, he was not more than three
hundred feet in the air.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the guest at the King&#8217;s Head had
made the most of his time. He had reasoned,
and not without truth, that if &#8220;The Hornet&#8221;
had ascended, the mechanic, Collins, would no
doubt leave the hangar, and, if so, that now would
be a good opportunity to obtain entrance.</p>

<p>With that in view he had crept along to the shed
and, as he had hoped, found the doors unlocked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Quickly he entered and, by the aid of his flash-lamp,
looked round.</p>

<p>At last the long tentacles of the German spy-bureau
in the &#8220;Königgrätzerstrasse&#8221; had spread
to the little village of Harbury.</p>

<p>Five minutes sufficed for the spy to complete
his observations. At an engineer&#8217;s bench he
halted and realised the technical details of a
certain part of the secret silencer. But only a
part, and by it he was pretty puzzled.</p>

<p>He held it in his hand in the light of his flash-lamp
and, in German exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ach!</i> I wonder how that can be? If we
could only obtain the secret of that silencer!&#8221;
the Hun continued to himself. &#8220;But we shall&mdash;no
doubt! I and my friends have not come
here for nothing. We have work before us&mdash;and
we shall complete it, if not to-day&mdash;then
in the near to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shabby stranger returned to the King&#8217;s
Head and, letting himself in, retired to his room
without a sound. Hardly had he undressed when
he heard again that low swish of &#8220;The Hornet&#8221;
on her return from her scouting circuit of the
Thames estuary.</p>

<p>Hans Leffner, <i>alias</i> Bean, had not been trained
as a spy for nothing. He was a crafty, clever
cosmopolitan, whose little eyes and wide ears
were ever upon the alert for information, and who
could pose perfectly in half-a-dozen disguises.
As the traveller of a Birmingham jewellery firm
he could entirely deceive the cheap jeweller
of any little town. He was one of many such
men who were passing up and down Great Britain,
learning all they could of our defences, our newest
inventions, and our intentions.</p>

<p>Next day Mr. Bean remained indoors at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
King&#8217;s Head, for it was a drenching day. But
at last, when the weather cleared at eight o&#8217;clock,
he lit his pipe and strolled out in the fading light.</p>

<p>Before leaving he had taken from the bottom
of the bag containing his samples of cheap
jewellery a small, thick screw-bolt about two
inches long, and placed it in his pocket with an
air of confidence.</p>

<p>Half-an-hour later he crept into the shed which
sheltered &#8220;The Hornet&#8221; and, not finding the
silencer upon the exhaust, as he had anticipated,
turned his attention to the fusilage of the biplane.
From this he quickly, and with expert hand,
unscrewed a bolt, swiftly substituting in its stead
the bolt he had brought, which he screwed in
place carefully with his pocket wrench.</p>

<p>The bolt he had withdrawn hung heavily in
his jacket-pocket, and as he stood, alert and eager,
there suddenly sounded the musical voice of a
woman.</p>

<p>Next second he had slipped out of the hangar
and gained cover in a thicket close by.</p>

<p>Beryl was crossing the grass, laughing gaily
in the falling light. With her were Pryor, and
Collins the mechanic. A few minutes before,
Ronald and she, having finished dinner, had put
on their flying-suits and, passing through the long
windows out upon the lawn, had bidden farewell
to Iris, as they were going on their usual patrol flight.</p>

<p>Ronald, leaving her suddenly, struck away
to the hangar and, entering it, turned up the
electric lights. With both hands he tested the
steel stays of the great biplane, and then, aided
by the mechanic, he wheeled the machine out
ready for an ascent, for the atmospheric conditions
were exactly suitable for an air raid by the
enemy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>&#8220;We had better go up and test the engines,
dear,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;This afternoon they were
not at all satisfactory.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beryl climbed into the observer&#8217;s seat, he
following as pilot, while Collins disappeared round
the corner of the hangar to get something.</p>

<p>Then the pair, seated beside each other and
tightly strapped in, prepared to ascend in the
increasing darkness.</p>

<p>The sudden roar of the powerful engines was
terrific, and could be heard many miles away,
for they were testing without the silencer.</p>

<p>Scarcely had they risen a hundred feet from the
ground when there was a sharp crack and &#8220;The
Hornet,&#8221; swerving, shed her right wing entirely,
and dived straight with her nose to the earth.</p>

<p>A crash, a heavy thud, and in an instant Ronald
and Beryl, happily strapped in their seats, were
half-stunned by the concussion. Had they not
been secured in their seats both must have been
killed, as the man Leffner had intended.</p>

<p>The engine had stopped, for, half the propeller
being broken, the other half had embedded
itself deeply into the ground. Collins came
running up, half frantic with fear, but was soon
reassured by the pair of intrepid aviators, who
unstrapped themselves and quickly climbed out
of the wreckage. Ere long a flare was lit and the
broken wing carefully examined; it was soon
discovered that &#8220;The Hornet&#8221; had been tampered
with, one of the steel bolts having been
replaced by a painted one of wood!</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the work of the enemy!&#8221; remarked
Ronnie thoughtfully. &#8220;They cannot obtain sight
of the silencer, therefore there has been a dastardly
plot to kill both of us. We must be a little more
wary in future, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>Ronald&#8217;s shrewdness did not show itself openly,
but having made a good many inquiries, both
in Harbury village and elsewhere, he, at last,
was able to identify the man who had made that
secret attempt upon their lives. Of this, however,
he said nothing to Beryl. &#8220;The Hornet&#8221; was
repaired, and they made night flights again.</p>

<p>Ronald anticipated that a second attempt
would be made to obtain the silencer. Taking
Collins into his confidence, he made it his habit
each dawn, when they came home from their
patrol of the coast, to leave in the little office
beside the hangar the box which contained the
silencer, the secret of which he knew the Germans
were so very anxious to obtain.</p>

<p>For a fortnight nothing untoward occurred,
until one morning soon after all three had returned
from a flight to London and back, they were
startled by a terrific explosion from the direction
of the hangar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; exclaimed Ronald. &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The trap has gone off, sir,&#8221; was Collins&#8217;s
grim reply.</p>

<p>All three ran back to the shed, whereupon
they saw that the little office had been entirely
swept away, and that part of the roof of the
hangar was off. Amid the wreckage lay the
body of a man with his face shattered, stone-dead.
&#8220;He thought the box contained the silencer,
and when he lifted the lid he received a nasty
shock, sir&mdash;eh?&#8221; Collins remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;But who is it, Ronald?&#8221; gasped Beryl,
horrified.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man who made the attempt on our
lives a month ago, dearest,&#8221; was her lover&#8217;s
reply. &#8220;Come away. He has paid the penalty
which all spies should pay.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>A few hours later Ronald Pryor made a statement
to the authorities which resulted in the
explosion being regarded, to all but those immediately
concerned, as a complete mystery.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>THE THURSDAY RENDEZVOUS.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Beryl Gaselee</span>, in her warm leather motor-coat
and close-fitting little hat, stood gazing
out of the coffee-room window of the Unicorn
Hotel in the quiet old cathedral town of Ripon,
in Yorkshire.</p>

<p>In the falling twilight of the wintry afternoon
all looked dull and cheerless. The car stood
outside with Ronald Pryor and Collins attending
to some slight engine-trouble&mdash;the fast, open
car which Ronnie sometimes used to such
advantage. It was covered with mud, after
the long run north from Suffolk, for they
had started from Harbury long before daylight,
and, until an hour ago, had been moving
swiftly up the Great North Road, by way of Stamford,
Grantham, and Doncaster to York. There
they had turned away to Ripon, where, for an
hour, they had eaten and rested. In a basket the
waiter had placed some cold food with some
bread and a bottle of wine, and this had been
duly transferred to the car.</p>

<p>All was now ready for a continuance of the
journey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Beryl!&#8221; exclaimed Ronnie, returning
to where the pretty young air-woman was standing
before the fire. &#8220;All ready&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite, dear,&#8221; was her reply. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
forgotten the revolvers, have you?&#8221; she asked
in a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. There&#8217;s one for each of us&mdash;and one
for you if you&#8217;d like it,&#8221; he laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I think I&#8217;d better have it, dear&mdash;one
never knows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much good against a machine-gun,
you know!&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;But a weapon always
gives one confidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had the flask filled with hot tea,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;We shall, no doubt, want it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. It will be a coldish job. Are you
quite warm enough&mdash;quite sure you are?&#8221; he
asked, as the white-haired old waiter entered the
snug, warm coffee-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite,&#8221; she answered, as she drew on her fur-lined
gloves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;good-evening, waiter!&#8221; exclaimed
Ronnie cheerily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-evening, sir,&#8221; replied the old man
pleasantly.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, with Ronnie driving, Beryl
snuggled at his side, and Collins seated under
the rug in the back of the car, they had passed
the dark, imposing façade of the grey, old cathedral
and were well out upon the darkening road,
through High Berrys and over Hutton Moor.
At last they reached Baldersby Gate, where they
turned into the long, straight Roman road which
runs direct north from York, and, though a
continuation of the old Watling Street, is there
known as Leeming Lane.</p>

<p>With nightfall there had arisen a cutting
north-east wind, that searching breeze which
all dwellers in Yorkshire know far too well, comes
over with the month of February.</p>

<p>From Baldersby Gate, past Sinderby Station,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
through Hope Town on to Leeming village, the
ancient road ran straight as an arrow, then, with
a slight curve to Leeming Station, it ran on to
Catterick. By this time they had passed the
race-course, which lay on the left of the road
before coming to the cross-roads; it was already
dark, and drawing up at Catterick Bridge Station,
Collins got down and lit the head-lamps, Ronald
Pryor having a written permission from Whitehall
to use them.</p>

<p>Striking across through the town of Richmond
they climbed the high hills over Hipswell and
Barden Moor to Leyburn, and then down into
Wensley Dale, famed for its cheeses, by the
northern road which took them through the
picturesque village of Redmire on to Askrigg as
far as a darkened and lonely inn close to Hardraw
Force. There they pulled up, and, entering,
asked for something to eat.</p>

<p>By that time, ten o&#8217;clock, all three were chilled
to the bone, after crossing those wide, open
moorlands, where the keen wind cut their faces
all the time. The landlady, a stout, cheerful
person, soon busied herself to provide creature
comforts for the travellers, and within a quarter
of an hour all were seated at a substantial
meal.</p>

<p>While the good woman was busying herself
at table Ronnie suddenly became inquisitive,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a friend of mine, a Mr. Aylesworth,
who often comes up to this neighbourhood. He
lives in Leeds, but he rents a cottage somewhere
about here. He&#8217;s a queer and rather lonely man.
Do you happen to know him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, sir! Mr. Aylesworth is quite well
known in Hardraw. He has rented old Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Dalton&#8217;s cottage, up on the hill at Simon Stone,
for quite eighteen months now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that far from here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only about half-a-mile up Buttertubs Pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Buttertubs! What a very curious name!&#8221;
Beryl remarked. &#8220;Where does the pass lead
to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, straight up over Abbotside Common,
just below Lovely Seat, and it comes out on the
high road in Swale Dale, close to Thwaite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is Dalton?&#8221; asked the airman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Farmer Dalton. He&#8217;s got several cottages
on his place. He himself lives over at Gayle,
close to Hawes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does my friend Aylesworth ever come in
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, very often, sir!&#8221; replied the woman.
&#8220;Everybody knows him. He&#8217;s such a real cheerful,
good-hearted gentleman. He&#8217;s always giving
away something. It&#8217;s a sad thing for many
about here that there&#8217;s no treating nowadays.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; laughed Beryl, &#8220;the order is, I hear
from my friends, very often broken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, miss,&#8221; the broad, round-faced
woman admitted. &#8220;You can&#8217;t always prevent
it, you know, though we folk do all we can,
because of our licenses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So my friend Aylesworth is quite popular?
I&#8217;m glad to hear that,&#8221; replied Ronnie. &#8220;He
lives here constantly nowadays, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, sir! He comes down here just at
odd times. Sometimes in the beginning of the
week; sometimes for the week-end,&#8221; was the
reply. &#8220;He&#8217;s often up in London&mdash;on Government
contracts, I&#8217;ve heard him say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beryl and her lover exchanged shrewd and
meaning glances.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, I know that Mr. Aylesworth must be
very busy,&#8221; remarked Pryor. &#8220;I suppose he
comes out here just for quiet and rest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. That&#8217;s it, sir,&#8221; replied the inn-keeper&#8217;s
wife. &#8220;Only the other day he called in here, and
was saying that he was so busy that it was a
complete change to come here to the moors for
rest and fresh air.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve had Zepps over here lately, I&#8217;ve heard.
Is that true?&#8221; inquired Ronnie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they&#8217;ve passed over once or twice, they
say, but I&#8217;ve been in bed and asleep. My husband
was called up last month, and is now in training
down in Kent. Only a week ago he wrote to me
saying he hoped I wasn&#8217;t frightened by them.
Somebody down in Kent had evidently spread
a report that they had been over here. But I&#8217;m
thankful to say I heard nothing of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you ever get aeroplanes over?&#8221; asked
Beryl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, miss! We get some across in the
daytime. They must have an aerodrome somewhere
on the coast, I think&mdash;but I don&#8217;t know
where it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you ever hear anything of them at
night?&#8221; inquired the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, just now and then. I&#8217;ve been awakened
sometimes by the humming of them passing over
at night&mdash;our patrols, I suppose they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ronald Pryor exchanged another meaning
glance with his well-beloved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do they sound quite near?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! quite&mdash;unusually low. I suppose they
man&oelig;uvre across the moors?&#8221; she said. &#8220;Mr.
Benton, the farmer who lives over at Crosslands,
quite close here, was only the other day telling
me a curious story. He said he was going home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
late the other night from Jack Sneath&#8217;s, when he
heard an aeroplane above him, and he saw the
machine making some flashlights&mdash;signalling to
somebody. It flew round and round, hovering
and signalling madly. Suddenly, he told me, the
aviator cut off his engine, as though he had
received an answer, and sailing over the moor,
descended somewhere close by, for the hum of
the engine was heard no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Curious!&#8221; Pryor remarked, again glancing
at his well-beloved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, sir!&#8221; replied the smiling woman.
&#8220;It was only the night man&oelig;uvres of our splendid
aircraft boys. Really everyone must admire
them,&#8221; she added, unaware of Ronald Pryor&#8217;s
qualifications as an air-pilot.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later all three were out on the road
again, travelling along the valley in the direction
of Hawes Junction. The night was overcast and
very dark, therefore Ronnie was compelled to
switch on his head-lights, the road at that part
being particularly dangerous.</p>

<p>The country they were now in was a wild and
lonely one, with high peaks and wide, desolate
moorlands; a sparsely populated district, far
removed from the busy workaday world.</p>

<p>They had travelled as far as the old inn called
the Moor Cock, where the road branches off to
Kirkby Stephen, when Ronnie pulled up, and,
turning, ran back again to within a mile of Hardraw.
Then finding a convenient grass field, he
ran the car in behind a low stone wall, where
it was hidden from any passer-by. Then, each
taking a flash-lamp and a revolver, they, after
shutting off the lights, sought a path which at
last they took, climbing up the steep hill-side.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour&#8217;s walk brought them to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
narrow, stony lane, which, after another quarter
of an hour, led them to a long, low, stone-built
cottage, surrounded by a clump of trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Dalton&#8217;s cottage,&#8221; remarked Ronnie.
&#8220;It answers exactly to the description we have
of it. Now, Collins, you get down on the left,
so as to have a good point of view while we watch
for anything stirring away on the right.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was then half-past ten o&#8217;clock. Though cold,
the night was very still on those lonely moorlands.
The house Ronnie and Beryl were approaching
was in total darkness, a gloomy, remote place
in which the mystery-man from Leeds, George
Aylesworth, came for rest and quiet after the
business turmoil of the great manufacturing town.</p>

<p>At last Ronald and his companion got up quite
close to the house, and finding a spot whence
they had a good view of the front door, they
crouched beneath an ivy-clad wall, and there,
without speaking, waited, knowing that Collins
was on watch at the rear of the premises.</p>

<p>Their vigil was a long and weary one until
at last the door opened. By the light within
there was revealed a tall, lean man in overcoat
and golf-cap. Beneath his left arm he carried
something long and round, like a cylinder, while
in his right hand he had a stout stick.</p>

<p>He came out, closed the door carefully behind
him, and then, passing close to where the air-woman
and her lover were crouched in concealment,
struck away up a steep, narrow path which
led up to the summit of the Black Hill. Happily
for the watchers the wind had now become rather
rough, hence they were able to follow the man
Aylesworth&mdash;for Ronald recognised him by the
description; keeping at a respectful distance, of
course, but determinedly dogging his footsteps.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>After walking for nearly half-a-mile up a steep
ascent, and over a stony path, the man Aylesworth
halted at a point which gave a view of the
moor, with its fells and dales, for many miles
around. From where Ronald halted he could
see the man faintly silhouetted against the skyline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; whispered Beryl. &#8220;What is he
doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch,&#8221; urged her companion.</p>

<p>And as they watched they suddenly saw a
beam of intense, white light, a miniature searchlight
of great brilliance, pierce the darkness skyward.
The man Aylesworth was manipulating
what they now recognised to be an acetylene
signalling apparatus, a cylinder mounted upon a
light tripod of aluminium, with a bright
reflector behind the gas-jet, and, from the manner
that the light began to &#8220;wink,&#8221; three times in
quick succession&mdash;the Morse letter &#8220;S.&#8221;&mdash;there
was evidently some shutter arrangement upon it.</p>

<p>Slowly the beam turned from north to south,
making the Morse &#8220;S.&#8221; upon the clouds time after
time.</p>

<p>Suddenly the light was shut off. For five
minutes by Ronald&#8217;s watch no flicker was shown.
Then, once again, the series of &#8220;S&#8217;s.&#8221; was repeated in
a semi-circle from north to south, and back again.</p>

<p>Another five minutes passed in darkness.</p>

<p>Once more the light opened out and commenced
to signal the Morse flashes and flares &#8220;N. F.,&#8221;
&#8220;N. F.,&#8221; &#8220;N. F.,&#8221; followed by a long beam of
light skyward, slowly sweeping in a circle.</p>

<p>Pryor glanced at his watch. It was then
exactly midnight. Aylesworth had, no doubt, a
rendezvous with someone. His signal could be
seen from that point over a radius of fully thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
miles, or even more, for Ronnie, who understood
signalling, was well aware that the portable
apparatus being used was one of the most intense
and reliable type&mdash;one that was, indeed, being
used by the German army in Flanders.</p>

<p>For the next half-hour the signals were repeated,
until, of a sudden, Beryl&#8217;s quick ears caught some
unusual sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark!&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>Both, on listening intently, heard the low hum
of a distant aeroplane in the darkness.</p>

<p>The light was signalling madly, and at the
same time the machine, high in the vault of the
night sky, was fast approaching. The pair
watched, straining their eyes to discover it, but
though the sound betrayed its presence, they could
not discern its whereabouts until there appeared
high over them a small, bright light, like a green
star, which repeated the signal &#8220;N. F.,&#8221; &#8220;N. F.,&#8221;
half-a-dozen times.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is most interesting!&#8221; whispered Ronald,
&#8220;Look! Why, he&#8217;s planing down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beryl watched, and saw how the aeroplane
which had come out of the night was now making
short spirals, and planing down as quickly as was
practicable in that rather dangerous wind.</p>

<p>Every moment the low hum of the engine
became more and more distinct as, time after
time, signals were shown in response to those
flashed by the mysterious man from Leeds.
Then ten minutes later the machine, which proved
to be a Fokker, came to earth only about fifty
yards from where Beryl and Ronald were standing.</p>

<p>Aylesworth ran up breathlessly the moment the
machine touched the grass, and with him the
watchers crept swiftly up, in order to try to overhear
the conversation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>It was in German. The aviator and his
observer climbed out of the seats and stood
with Mr. Aylesworth, chatting and laughing.</p>

<p>The pilot calmly lit a cigarette, and drawing
something from his pocket, gave it to the man
who had been awaiting his arrival. Thereupon,
Aylesworth, on his part, handed the airman a
letter, saying in English:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all to-night. Please tell Count von
Stumnitz that the reply will not be given till
Thursday next. By that time we shall have
news from the North Sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent,&#8221; replied the aviator, who spoke
English perfectly, and who, if the truth were
told, had before the war lived the life of a bachelor
in Jermyn Street. &#8220;I shall be over again on
Thursday at midnight punctually. I must run up
from the south next time. The anti-aircraft
found me on the coast and fired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you come on Thursday I&#8217;ll have
the despatch ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly the observer, who spoke in German,
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have some letters here from the Wilhelmstrasse.
Will you post them for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are all ready. They are written upon
English paper, and English penny stamps are
upon them. Therefore, they can be put into
any post-box, and will not arouse suspicion.
They mostly contain instructions to our good
friends who are scattered over Great Britain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aylesworth took from the man&#8217;s hand a packet
of letters tied with string&mdash;secret despatches from
the German General Staff to the Kaiser&#8217;s spies
in Great Britain&mdash;and thrust them into the
big pocket of his overcoat.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>The two Huns and the traitor stood there
together in cheery conversation. Much that
they said Ronald and Beryl could not overhear.
Sometimes there was low whispering, sometimes
a burst of hilarious laughter. But it was evident
that all three were in perfect accord, and that
the aviator and his observer were well-known
to Mr. Aylesworth of Leeds.</p>

<p>Far away&mdash;many miles off&mdash;there showed a
faint tremor in the sky, the flash of a distant
anti-aircraft searchlight. Now and then it
trembled, then all became dark again. The pair
of enemies, who that night had landed upon
British soil, at last decided that it was high
time for them to hie back over the North Sea,
therefore they climbed again into their machine&mdash;one
of the fastest and newest of the Fokker
type&mdash;and for a few minutes busied themselves
in testing their instruments and engine.</p>

<p>The pilot descended again to have a final look
round, after which he once more climbed up to
his seat, while Aylesworth, acting as mechanic&mdash;for,
if the truth be told, he had been an aviator&#8217;s
mechanic at Hendon for three years before the
outbreak of war&mdash;gave the propeller a swing over.</p>

<p>There was a loud roar, the machine leapt
forward over the withered heather, bumping along
the uneven surface, until, gaining speed, the tail
slowly lifted, and after a run of a couple of hundred
yards, the Fokker skimmed easily away off the
ground.</p>

<p>As Ronnie watched in silence he saw that for
another fifty yards the German pilot held her
down, and then, with a rush and that quick swoop
of which the Fokker is capable, up she went,
and away!</p>

<p>She made a circuit of perhaps eight hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
feet and then sped somewhere into the darkness
upon a straight eastward course to the coast, and
over the rough North Sea.</p>

<p>As the pair watched, still arm-in-arm, they
again saw the faint tremor of our searchlights
in the far distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouff! Wouff! Wouff!&#8221; sounded faintly
far away.</p>

<p>The Fokker had been picked up by our anti-aircraft
boys, and was being fired upon!</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouff! Wouff!&#8221; again sounded afar. But
the bark of the shell died away, and it seemed plain
that the Hun machine had, by a series of side-slips,
nose-dives, and quick turns, avoided our
anti-aircraft guns, and was well on its way carrying
those secret communications to the German
General Staff.</p>

<p>The enemy pilot had &#8220;streaked off&#8221; eastwards,
and to sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we know this fellow Aylesworth&#8217;s
game!&#8221; whispered Ronnie. &#8220;Next Thursday
he will be sending away some important message.
Therefore, we must be here to have a finger in
the enemy&#8217;s pie&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, dearest,&#8221; replied the gallant little
woman at his side. &#8220;It certainly is a <i>coup</i> for
you that you have discovered this secret means
of communication between ourselves and the
enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not really,&#8221; he said in a low voice. &#8220;Our
people scented the mystery, and have handed it
on to me to investigate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we know that something is leaving us
on Thursday&mdash;some important information.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so. And is it up to us to see that Aylesworth
does not send it across the sea successfully&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get away now,&#8221; urged Beryl. &#8220;He
may discover us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ronald stood, his arm linked in that of his
well-beloved. He made no remark as he watched
the dark silhouette of the man Aylesworth
disappear over the brow of the hill.</p>

<p>Presently he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, dear, he hasn&#8217;t discovered us. But
if all goes well we shall be back here on
Thursday.&#8221;</p>

<p>Half-an-hour later they met Collins awaiting
them near the car. The mechanic became
greatly interested when his master described
briefly what they had seen.</p>

<p>Then all three mounted into their seats, the
lights were switched on, and they turned back to
Kirkby Stephen, where they spent the remainder
of the night at the old &#8220;King&#8217;s Arms,&#8221; giving
a fictitious story of a breakdown.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two days later, Pryor having made a long
written report to the Anti-Aircraft Headquarters,
took the train from Liverpool Street Station
down to Harbury Court, there to await instructions.
Beryl, who was already down there
with Iris, was greatly excited, for only she,
Ronald, and Collins knew of the intended <i>coup</i>
next Thursday. Zeppelins had sailed over the
East Coast, and had paid the penalty for so
doing. &#8220;Uncle&#8221;&mdash;the pet name for Count
Zeppelin at the Potsdam Court&mdash;was, it was
reported, in tears of rage. He had promised
the Kaiser that he would appal Great Britain,
but the British refused even to be alarmed.
The Zeppelin menace, thought by the world to
be so serious, had &#8220;fizzled out,&#8221; and it now seemed
that the more mobile aeroplane&mdash;often with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
British tri-colour rings upon its wings&mdash;had taken
its place. And it was one of those which Ronnie
and Beryl knew would be due over that Yorkshire
moor next Thursday at midnight.</p>

<p>Ronnie spent the night at Harbury, and in the
morning received a telegram calling him urgently to
Whitehall. On his return, he said but little, though,
from his smile, Beryl knew that he was
satisfied.</p>

<p>Wednesday came, and in his brown overalls he
spent nearly the whole day with Collins in
&#8220;The Hornet&#8217;s Nest.&#8221; They were getting the
machine in trim for a long night flight.</p>

<p>Both pilot and mechanic consumed many
cigarettes as they worked, Ronnie examining
every stay and every instrument. He satisfied
himself that the Lewis gun, which could fire
through the propeller, was in working order, and
he tested the silencer, which he brought out from
the house for that purpose, and then returned
it to its place of safety from the prying eyes of
the enemy.</p>

<p>Now and then Beryl came out and watched
the preparations.</p>

<p>Thursday dawned grey and overcast, with every
indication of rain. Indeed, rain fell at ten
o&#8217;clock, but at eleven, it having cleared, Ronnie
took Collins, and they went up for a &#8220;flip&#8221;
together in order to make a final test.</p>

<p>Beryl and her sister stood in the meadow
watching the machine ascend higher and higher,
until it had gained an altitude of fully twelve
thousand feet. Then it seemed to hover for a
moment, after which, with a long, graceful
swoop, Ronnie commenced a series of aerial
evolutions which Beryl, as an accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
air-woman, knew to be most difficult, and showed
to her what perfect control Ronald had over the
machine. The silencer was on, therefore no
sound could be heard of the engines.</p>

<p>In about twenty minutes&#8217; time Ronnie came
lightly to earth, and pulled up close to where Iris
and her sister were standing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything going finely!&#8221; he shouted to
Beryl, as he unstrapped himself, and clambered
out of the pilot&#8217;s seat.</p>

<p>Then, when he joined her, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;As the crow flies the spot on the moor is
about two hundred and thirty miles from here.
Therefore we ought to leave soon after seven
in case we lose our way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, after luncheon, they spent the afternoon
studying maps and marking directions by which
to steer, by the lines of railway mostly. Night
flying, with the lights of towns extinguished, is
always a difficult matter, and, as Beryl knew by
experience, it is extremely easy to lose one&#8217;s way
by a single mistake.</p>

<p>By seven o&#8217;clock darkness had already fallen;
but the barometer, at which both had glanced
many times with anxious eyes, showed a slow,
steady rise, and with the direction of the wind,
combined to create excellent conditions for flying
at high altitudes.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Hornet&#8221; had been wheeled out of its
&#8220;nest,&#8221; and Beryl in her fur-lined aviation kit,
her leather cap and goggles, had strapped herself
in behind her lover, who, with a flash-lamp, was now
busily examining the row of instruments before
him. Meanwhile Collins, on the ground, shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Best of luck to you, sir, and also to Miss Beryl!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Collins!&#8221; cried the girl. &#8220;We
ought to be back by five.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>&#8220;All ready, Collins?&#8221; asked Ronnie at last
sharply.</p>

<p>The mechanic sprang to the propeller.</p>

<p>&#8220;Contact, sir?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Ronnie threw over the switch with a click.
The mechanic swung the big, four-bladed propeller
over, when the engine started with noisy, metallic
clatter, increasing until it became a deep roar.</p>

<p>Ronnie was testing his engine. Finding it
satisfactory, he quickly throttled down. Collins
took the &#8220;chocks&#8221; from beneath the wheels,
and the pilot &#8220;taxied&#8221; slowly across to the corner
of the big field until, gaining speed, he opened
up suddenly, when the machine skimmed easily
off the ground, over the belt of trees, and away
up into the void.</p>

<p>As they ascended, Beryl, gazing down, saw
below a few faint lights to the south-east, and
knew that there lay the important town of H&mdash;&mdash;,
blotted out at even that early hour of the evening,
for the lights visible would have only indicated
a village in pre-war days.</p>

<p>In the sky further eastwards toward the sea was
a slight tremor of light showing that searchlights
were already at work testing their beams, and
making oblong patches of light upon the clouds.</p>

<p>At ten thousand feet up, as the altimeter then
showed, it was intensely cold, and the girl
buttoned up her fur-lined coat and fastened up
her wind-cuffs. The roar of the engine was too
great, of course, to admit of conversation.
Ronnie had not switched on the silencer, as it
impeded speed, and after a long flight it might
choke just at the very moment when its services
were most required.</p>

<p>Due north in the increasing darkness went
&#8220;The Hornet,&#8221; skilfully handled by the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
intrepid of air-pilots, high over town, forest, and
pasture, hill and dale, as the hours crept slowly
on.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, Ronnie turned the machine,
and began to circle over a few scattered lights.
Then Beryl recognised his uncertainty. Time
after time he searched for the railway line to
York, but though both of them strained their eyes
they could not pick it up again.</p>

<p>Hence they were compelled, much to Ronnie&#8217;s
chagrin, to make a descent in a big grass-field,
where, in the blackness, they made a rather
rough landing, and presently inquired their
whereabouts of some villagers.</p>

<p>To their amazement they found that beneath
the hill where they had descended the railway
line actually ran. And it was on account of the
long tunnel they had missed it.</p>

<p>So, ascending once more, they struck again due
north by the compass, and finding the line, flew
along it over Doncaster to York. Then, still
continuing northwards, they reached Thirsk
Junction, until five minutes later as they were
approaching Northallerton, intending to strike
westward and follow the line to Hawes, &#8220;The
Hornet&#8221; developed serious engine trouble, and
Ronnie was forced again to descend, planing
down into an unploughed field.</p>

<p>For half-an-hour, aided actively by Beryl, he
was occupied in making a repair. It was then
past eleven, and the girl expressed a hope that
they would be at the rendezvous by midnight.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will really be too bad if we arrive too
late,&#8221; she added apprehensively.</p>

<p>Ronnie did not reply. He was seriously contemplating
giving up the expedition. The engine
trouble was a very serious one. They might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
last out perhaps another hour, but &#8220;The Hornet&#8221;
could never return to Harbury with the engine
in that state. This distressing fact, however, he
did not tell her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark!&#8221; cried Beryl suddenly. &#8220;Listen!
Why, there&#8217;s a machine up&mdash;over us!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ronald hold his breath. Yes, there was the
distinct hum of a machine coming up from the
east, following the railway from the main line
over towards Hawes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! do let&#8217;s go up. That may be Aylesworth&#8217;s
friend,&#8221; suggested Beryl.</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect it is,&#8221; replied Ronnie grimly. &#8220;But
with this engine there is danger&mdash;very grave
danger&mdash;Beryl, dear. Are you quite prepared
to risk it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll risk anything with you,&#8221; was the girl&#8217;s
prompt reply. &#8220;We&#8217;ve risked our lives in the
air before, and we&#8217;ll do so again to-night. We
must not fail now that we&#8217;re within an ace of
success.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her words spurred Ronnie to a supreme effort.
With the hum of the mysterious machine in his
ears, he set his teeth; then with the spanner in
his hand he screwed the nut tightly, and without
many further words he told his well-beloved
that all was ready. They both got in, and two
minutes later they were rising in the air, rapidly
overhauling the mysterious machine.</p>

<p>Those moments seemed hours to Beryl. She
scarcely dared to breathe. Ronnie had switched
on the silencer, and they were now speeding
through the air without a sound, save for the
shrill whistle of the wind through the planes.</p>

<p>By the hum of the engine of the machine they
were following they kept silently in its wake,
gradually overhauling it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>Suddenly they saw flashes of white light from it&mdash;signals
to the traitor Aylesworth in waiting
below. Then they knew that they were not
mistaken.</p>

<p>Ronnie put every ounce into his crocked-up
engine, knowing that if it failed they might make
a nose-dive fatal to them both. Like an arrow
he sped towards the aeroplane which had crept
over the North Sea, and across Yorkshire to meet
the man who had promised those secret despatches.</p>

<p>Beryl saw deep below the flashes of a lamp&mdash;&#8220;N.
F.,&#8221; &#8220;N. F.,&#8221; in Morse.</p>

<p>Ronald Pryor saw it also and, suddenly turning
the nose of his machine, he made a circle in silence
around the enemy aeroplane. Again he circled
much nearer. The German pilot was utterly
ignorant of his presence, so silently did he pass
through the air, until, narrowing the circle,
he waited for the Fokker to plane down; then, in
a flash, he flew past, and, with his hand upon the
Lewis gun, he showered a veritable hail of lead
upon it.</p>

<p>The Fokker reeled, and then nose-dived to
earth, with&mdash;as was afterwards found&mdash;its pilot
shot through the brain, its petrol-tank pierced
in five places, and one of its wings hanging limp
and broken, such a terrible shower of lead had
Pryor directed against it.</p>

<p>Beryl and Ronald Pryor had perforce to return
by train to Harbury, but, by previous arrangement,
the man Aylesworth had been arrested,
and was duly tried by court-martial. It is known
that he was found guilty and condemned, but
the exact sentence upon him will probably not
be known until after the declaration of peace.</p>

<p>And, after all, the doom of a traitor is best
left unrecorded.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>CONCERNS THE HIDDEN HAND.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> evening&mdash;the evening of June 14th, 1916,
to be exact&mdash;Ronald Pryor came forth through
one of the long French windows which led out
upon the sloping lawn at Harbury Court, and
gazed out upon the extensive and picturesque
landscape; the low ridge of hills was soft in the
grey and crimson of the summer afterglow.</p>

<p>With Beryl, and Iris, he had dined an hour
ago, after which Beryl had gone for a flight in
&#8220;The Hornet.&#8221; She had been away more than
half-an-hour when, seated alone, he drained his
liqueur, placed his cigarette-end in the ash-tray,
and glanced anxiously at his wrist-watch.</p>

<p>Then he had gone out into the calm June night.</p>

<p>Passing from the spacious gardens surrounding
the Court&mdash;ill-kept nowadays, for all the men
were serving in the Army&mdash;he went down to
&#8220;The Hornet&#8217;s Nest.&#8221;</p>

<p>He opened the sliding door sufficiently to allow
himself to enter, and for the next hour he was busy
within. At last he reappeared with an old,
wide-mouthed kitbag, similar to those used by
hunting men in pre-war days.</p>

<p>Carrying it across the field to the opposite
corner, he opened it beneath the high elm-tree
which they were always compelled to avoid in
their ascents or descents. Then he took out a
coil of black-enamelled wire, the end of which
bore a lead plummet. Carefully examining the
coil, he held it loosely in his hand and, stepping
back a few paces, quickly swung the lead around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
his head half-a-dozen times, and then, with a
sudden jerk, released it, sending it high up into
the branches of the tree, where it remained with
its wire attached. A few feet down the wire,
towards the ground, there had been inserted a
brown porcelain insulator, while, as the airman
paid out the wire, receding from the tree as he
did so, a second insulator came into view.</p>

<p>Having let out sufficient wire, he at last pegged
its end to the ground. Thus, from the grass to
the tree, stretched up a long single wire. From
his square-mouthed bag he took out a small
box of polished mahogany and, opening it, there
was disclosed within a complete little wireless
set. A small mat of copper gauze he took also
from the bag and, spreading it upon the damp
grass as an &#8220;earth,&#8221; he connected up his
instruments with expert hand.</p>

<p>Presently he glanced at the watch on his wrist;
by this time the twilight was rapidly falling, the
mists were rising, and a few sparks of light could
be seen twinkling deep down in the grey valley.
Then he removed his cap and, assuming the double
head &#8217;phones, carefully adjusted his detector and
listened attentively.</p>

<p>From anyone passing along the high road he
was entirely hidden from view. The possession
of wireless was forbidden under heavy penalty
by the Defence of the Realm Act, but Ronnie
Pryor was one of the fortunate few whose permits
for experiment had been recently renewed by the
Admiralty.</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; he exclaimed aloud. &#8220;There&#8217;s
Norddeich going strong, sending out the usual
German official lies&mdash;and also the Eiffel Tower.
Two budgets of official war news at the same
time!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>Again he listened with great patience and
attention, as he knelt upon the grass. The neat
little installation was, of course, for receiving
only, there being no electrical current for transmission.
A small, round ebonite handle at the
end of the box he turned backwards and forwards
very slowly, altering his wave-length ever and
anon, making it longer or shorter in order to
&#8220;tune&#8221; himself to the message he was apparently
expecting.</p>

<p>Once again he glanced at his watch very
anxiously. Then, for the next three-quarters
of an hour, while the dusk deepened into darkness,
he remained upon his patient vigil.</p>

<p>&#8220;At last!&#8221; he gasped aloud, as he switched
on a little shaded lamp which shone obliquely
within the box; then he bent down, and, on a
small writing-pad, began to take down rapidly
the letters he heard in Morse code&mdash;an unintelligible
jumble of the alphabet, each nine letters
being separated by a space.</p>

<p>Presently there ticked into his ears the three
&#8220;shorts,&#8221; followed by &#8220;long-short-long,&#8221;
which signified &#8220;end of work.&#8221; Still bending to
the tiny light, he took from his pocket a little
book. On consulting it, he placed over each
code-letter its de-coded equivalent, afterwards
reading it to his apparent satisfaction.</p>

<p>Then he rose, standing with his face to the
north, and gazing over the wide valley into the
night sky. He lit a cigarette, and remained
there for a full quarter of an hour. Afterwards
he consulted a map from his pocket and then,
lighting another cigarette, waited somewhat
impatiently. Now and then he could hear the
roar of a car or a motor-cycle passing along the
high road at the back of him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>About three-quarters of an hour after the reception
of the message, Pryor connected up four
dry batteries he had in his bag to a lamp with
a wide lens, which he placed on its back upon
the ground, so that the beams were directed
upwards. Then again, after pulling down the
wire, he seated himself upon a root of the great
tree and waited, listening very attentively.</p>

<p>At last he heard a faint hum in the darkness&mdash;a
low sound like the distant buzzing of a bee.</p>

<p>It was approaching rapidly&mdash;an aeroplane
high in the dark sky, for neither moon nor stars
showed that night. The machine was approaching
from the direction of London, yet, though he
strained his eyes, he could not distinguish it in
that dark-blue vault above.</p>

<p>On it came rapidly in his direction. Into the
electric circuit he had put a little tapping-key
and, touching it, he tapped out the Morse letters:
&#8220;X X D&#8221;&mdash;his own wireless call number.</p>

<p>Time after time he repeated the call &#8220;X X D&mdash;X
X D!&#8221; at the same time straining his eyes
into the darkness.</p>

<p>Suddenly, almost exactly above him, he saw,
like a tiny star in the sky, a light twinkling. He
read the message, and knew that his signal
had been seen and read.</p>

<p>Next second he tapped out upon the key&mdash;flashing
it to the arriving aeroplane&mdash;the direction
of the light wind, afterwards opening up the light
to serve as a guide. The aeroplane, humming
above in the darkness, swept down lower and lower
in half-mile spirals until, of a sudden, a powerful
searchlight beamed out from it, directed upon
the earth below; its pilot was looking for a safe
landing-place.</p>

<p>Slowly it circled round and round until, a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
minutes later, it came to earth in the opposite
corner of the field to that in which Ronnie was
standing. In an instant, with the cessation of
the throbbing of the engine, the light was shut
off, and Pryor, having long ago packed up his
wireless, hastened across.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; he shouted into the darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, Ronnie!&#8221; answered a girl&#8217;s voice
cheerily, and a few seconds later Beryl Gaselee
received a warm and fond caress.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got your message all right, darling!&#8221; the
man exclaimed, while the girl, in her workmanlike
air-woman&#8217;s kit, stood before the propeller
and stretched her arms above her head after her
long flight away into Hampshire and back. By
the light of Ronnie&#8217;s flash-lamp she was revealed
in her leather flying-cap, her hair tucked away
beneath it, her mackintosh confined at the waist
by a wide belt, and, instead of a skirt, brown
mechanic&#8217;s overalls.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came across Bedford and St. Albans, but
just beyond I had a terrible fright. I was flying
low in order to pick up a railway-line when, of
a sudden, a searchlight opened up from somewhere
and I was attacked by two anti-aircraft
guns. One shell whistled within five yards of
the left plane of &#8216;The Hornet.&#8217; Indeed, it was
quite a miracle that I was not winged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But couldn&#8217;t the fools see the rings on the
planes? Didn&#8217;t you bank in order to show
them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I did, but I was in a cloud, and they
could not see me with any accuracy. You see,
I never gave word to headquarters that I was
going up. I quite forgot it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, in that case it is only natural that
they would fire upon any stray aircraft at night!&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Ronnie replied. &#8220;But I got your message all
right, which proves that our wireless works well.
Where were you when you sent it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had flown about ten miles beyond Oxford.
I had some trouble with the engine, so I was
late in starting,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;You left your
kit in the machine,&#8221; she added, and, climbing
again into &#8220;The Hornet,&#8221; she threw out a leather
cap and a heavy mackintosh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you hear anything suspicious?&#8221; she
asked, as he placed the bag containing the wireless
in the observer&#8217;s seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;It was just as we have
guessed&mdash;enemy messages on a short wave-length.
Not very plain, to be sure, but they are being
transmitted, without a doubt. I heard you
perfectly,&#8221; he added. &#8220;But we haven&#8217;t much
time to waste if we are to keep the appointment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8217;bus is going beautifully,&#8221; Beryl said.
&#8220;I should have had quite a pleasant trip if it
were not for the &#8216;Archie-fire.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They may believe that the enemy send
aeroplanes over to us at night painted to resemble
ours. That is the reason you got peppered,
no doubt,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We must give that station
a wide berth in future.&#8221;</p>

<p>Climbing into the pilot&#8217;s seat he examined the
map set beneath the small electric bulb, and afterwards
slipped on his airman&#8217;s coat and cap, and
buckled the strap round his waist. Then, after
she had swung over the propeller, he helped his
well-beloved into the observer&#8217;s seat into which
she strapped herself.</p>

<p>With a quick bumpy run they sped over the
pasture, and then, on the lower ground, they rose
with a roar of the engine, turned and, passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
over the high road, circled over the opposite
hill. Higher and higher Ronnie went up into
the starless darkness, making great circles in
order to get up five thousand feet.</p>

<p>As the speed increased in the darkness the
machine, thrusting its nose still upwards and lying
over resolutely in its long spiral climb, throbbed
onward until, at a thousand feet, there came to
both a delicious sense of relief as they moved
along on an even keel.</p>

<p>For over an hour they flew until they were
high above the long, steep High Street of Guildford,
where only a few twinkling lights could be
seen below, owing to the excellent precautions
of its Chief Constable. At that altitude, from
the number of lights, an enemy airman would
never have suspected it to be a town at all.</p>

<p>It was not long, however&mdash;even while they
were circling above the town and Ronnie was
taking his bearings&mdash;before two intense beams
from searchlights shot out and almost blinded
the aviators. For fully two minutes the lights
followed them. Then the watchers below, having
satisfied themselves that it was a friendly &#8217;plane,
shut off again, and all was darkness.</p>

<p>They had flown perhaps nine miles from
Guildford when, of a sudden, almost directly
below them, there sprang up four points of red
light&mdash;lit simultaneously by an electrical wire&mdash;which
showed them their landing-place.</p>

<p>Down they swept until Ronnie, an expert in
landing at night, found himself in a large grass-field.
Collins came running forward eagerly to
welcome him.</p>

<p>The four lights were at once extinguished, and
the engine being shut off, all was quiet again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir, I think you&#8217;re quite right,&#8221; Collins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
said at last. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been watching these two days,
and there&#8217;s something mysterious in the wind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen them?&#8221; asked Ronnie eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. A youngish man and a stout old
woman. When I got down I found Shawfield to
be only a tiny place with one old inn, The Bell,
and I knew that a stranger&#8217;s movements would
be well watched. So I went three miles farther,
and took a room at The George, in Bricklehurst.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How far is the farm from here?&#8221; asked Beryl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, about a mile&mdash;not more, miss! Behind
that wood yonder,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;They had a
visitor this afternoon&mdash;a tall, fair, well-dressed
man. He&#8217;s probably spending the night there.
I watched him arrive at Shawfield Station, and
the man who calls himself Cator met him, and
drove him in the car to the Manor Farm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder who the visitor is?&#8221; remarked
Pryor.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is probably one of the gang,&#8221; Beryl
suggested. &#8220;No doubt he has come down from
London to see them in secret. The woman
poses as Cator&#8217;s mother, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, miss. I&#8217;ve discovered that they bought
the Manor Farm in 1913, and that Cator had an
excellent assistant, a Belgian, it was supposed&mdash;or
at least he gave himself out to be that. Cator
erected new farm-buildings that you will see&mdash;nice,
red-brick structures with corrugated iron
roofs, and spent a large sum of money on
improvements.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;New buildings&mdash;eh?&#8221; sniffed Ronnie in
suspicion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s just the point, sir. But let&#8217;s
get over there, and I&#8217;ll show you one or two things
that I regard as suspicious.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon the pair, guided by Collins, threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
off their air-clothes and crossed the field to a gate
where a footpath led into a dark wood, the air-mechanic
switching on a pocket-torch to light
their way. They conversed only in whispers,
lest there should be anyone lurking in the vicinity,
and on traversing the wood, found themselves out
upon a broad highway. Then, after going perhaps
a quarter of a mile, they turned into a second wood
and continued through it until, at its farther
boundary, they saw before them, silhouetted
against the night sky, a cluster of farm-buildings,
with the farmhouse itself close by.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; urged Collins. Then, drawing his
companions near him, he halted and whispered,
&#8220;See that long building&mdash;away from the others?
That&#8217;s where the mystery lies!&#8221;</p>

<p>They both strained their eyes, and could see
distinctly the long, low-built structure straight
before them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Follow me,&#8221; Collins whispered. &#8220;Be careful
to make no noise. There are two dogs in the yard
yonder, but they&#8217;re chained up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a mercy!&#8221; Beryl remarked, as the
pair moved slowly after the mechanic.</p>

<p>Suddenly, when they came out upon an ill-made
track which was evidently a byway,
Collins stopped and, turning his flash-lamp upon
the ground, pointed out the recent marks of
wheels, the broad, flat-tyred wheels of a motor-lorry.</p>

<p>&#8220;See what&#8217;s been here of late&mdash;eh?&#8221; he
whispered. &#8220;Look!&#8221; and he slowly flashed the
light across the road. &#8220;It&#8217;s been here quite
half-a-dozen times recently&mdash;on different nights or
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Ronnie. &#8220;You are quite
right! Do those tracks lead up to the building?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>&#8220;Yes. Come and see.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went, and before the big, heavy doors
which were locked so securely they saw, by the
faint light the man showed, marks of where the
lorry had backed right into the building.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it must have a concrete floor!&#8221;
remarked Ronnie as he examined the tracks
intently. &#8220;Several lorries have been here, without
a doubt. But might they not have been
carting grain away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Because no threshing has been done
here for over two years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dare we go near the house?&#8221; Beryl asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, miss; it wouldn&#8217;t be wise. We&#8217;d have
to pass through the yard, and the dogs would give
tongue at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we mustn&#8217;t alarm them!&#8221; Ronnie said.
&#8220;If we are to be successful we must do everything
in secret and spring a real surprise. Only,&#8221;
he added, &#8220;we must make quite certain that they
are guilty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Beryl agreed. &#8220;But how?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s the point!&#8221; said Ronnie, taking
out his own torch, and again examining the tracks
of the lorry in the soft ground. With the aid
of a folding foot-rule he drew forth from his
pocket, he took measurements at several points
in the road, then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not always the same lorry that comes
here. One is heavier than the other. The one
which came most recently is the larger of the two,
and from the depth of the rut it must have been
loaded to its capacity. See there, where it sank
into a soft place!&#8221;&mdash;and he indicated a spot
where one wheel had sunk in very deeply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Further,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;I judge, by the recent
dry weather, that those lorries have been here at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
intervals of about three days. They came from
some considerable distance, no doubt. The last
was here yesterday, in which case the next would
be here the day after to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I can stay and see with my own eyes?&#8221;
suggested Collins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly my idea,&#8221; his master replied. &#8220;You
could be an actual witness, and make a statement
before I dare act.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment all three were startled by
hearing voices. People were coming out of the
farmhouse. The dogs in the yard barked&mdash;showing
that the voice of one of the persons was
that of a stranger&mdash;the man from London.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick!&#8221; cried Collins. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get into
hiding somewhere. I hope they won&#8217;t let those
infernal dogs loose, or they&#8217;ll soon scent us out!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not!&#8221; said Beryl, who, though a lover
of dogs, held farm dogs, in such circumstances,
in distinct suspicion.</p>

<p>All three sped quickly back, crouching behind
a wooden fence close by, just as the fitful light of
a lantern could be seen approaching. Three
persons were revealed&mdash;the man Cator, his
guest, and the fat old woman.</p>

<p>Ronnie and Beryl strained their ears to catch
their conversation, but at first they could not
distinguish a single word.</p>

<p>Suddenly the woman, with a loud laugh,
spoke more distinctly. Yes! She spoke in
German, the man from London answering in the
same language!</p>

<p>They walked to the door of the long, low
building which, after some difficulty, the man
Cator unlocked, leaving his old hurricane-lamp
outside. The trio went in; therefore it was plain
one of them carried an electric torch.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>&#8220;I suppose they are showing him their handiwork&mdash;eh?&#8221;
remarked Beryl in a whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt. He has come down from London
to make an inspection, it seems.&#8221;</p>

<p>They could hear voices speaking in German
within the building, but dared not emerge from
their place of concealment to peer within. Ronnie
had suggested it, but Beryl urged a judicious
course.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, let Collins remain and watch,&#8221; she said
in a whisper. &#8220;Every moment we remain here
means graver peril to our plans. If they scent
the slightest suspicion, then all our efforts will
be in vain. Have you noticed over there?
I&#8217;ve been looking at it for some minutes, and I
don&#8217;t think my eyes deceive me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; asked Ronnie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, look at that chimney-stack upon the
farmhouse! Can&#8217;t you see something&mdash;a wire
running from it right away to that high tree on
the left?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;by Gad! That&#8217;s so, Beryl! Why,
they&#8217;ve got wireless here! They evidently string
up an aerial at night!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I haven&#8217;t noticed that before!&#8221; said
Collins. &#8220;But no doubt you&#8217;re right, sir. That&#8217;s
a wireless aerial, without question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. But let&#8217;s get away,&#8221; Ronnie urged.
&#8220;They may release those horrible dogs for a run,
and then it would be all up.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the trio, creeping cautiously, receded by
the dark path along which they had reached the
Manor Farm, and were soon back again in the
Monk&#8217;s Wood, as Collins told them it was named.</p>

<p>Back again at the spot where they had left
&#8220;The Hornet&#8221; they held council.</p>

<p>&#8220;You remain here, Collins,&#8221; said Pryor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
&#8220;Watch the place, and see what arrives. The
next lorry may come along the day after to-morrow,
or the day after that. You will see
what its load is. Then, having made certain,
come back straight to Harbury. We&#8217;ll wait for
you there. Telephone me, but not from the
locality. You understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, sir,&#8221; replied the air-mechanic,
who, in a rather shabby blue suit, wore a brass
badge as one doing national work.</p>

<p>Ronnie and Beryl climbed back into the
machine, fastened the straps round themselves,
and made all ready for their long flight from
Surrey, across London, to Harbury Court.</p>

<p>They said good-bye to Collins, who, taking
the propeller, pulled it over, while Pryor threw
over the contact.</p>

<p>There was no response.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo! What&#8217;s up?&#8221; asked Ronnie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know, sir,&#8221; Collins said. &#8220;Try again.&#8221;</p>

<p>They both tried again&mdash;and again, but no
response could be got out of the engine. &#8220;The
Hornet&#8221; had lost its sting!</p>

<p>Both pilot and observer descended again to
make a minute investigation. Both of them were
conversant with every point of an aero-engine, but
neither could discover the fault. &#8220;The Hornet&#8221;
had simply broken down!</p>

<p>For nearly an hour the trio worked hard to
get a move on the engine, but without success.</p>

<p>At last Ronald declared that it would be best
to wait until dawn, so they sat down upon the
grass beneath the hedge, smoking cigarettes and
chatting.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; exclaimed Ronnie. &#8220;If it is
really true what we suspect, how we shall surprise
them&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, dear,&#8221; said his well-beloved. &#8220;But
Collins must have absolute and undeniable
evidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. We cannot act without that.
See over there&mdash;the faint light in the sky.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he pointed to the pale light, eastward,
which heralded the dawn.</p>

<p>Already the birds were twittering, and away
somewhere a dog was barking furiously. In
pre-war times the chimes of village church clocks
would have struck the hour. But now, in fear
of enemy aircraft, all chimes were silent.</p>

<p>Slowly the light stole over the hill, and
presently all three walked over to &#8220;The Hornet&#8221;
for another minute examination. Within ten
minutes Collins had found the fault&mdash;quite a
usual but unexpected one&mdash;and five minutes
afterwards the engine was ready for the ascent.</p>

<p>Pryor climbed into the pilot&#8217;s seat to test it,
and did so half-a-dozen times before he pronounced
his verdict that the machine was in a fit
condition to fly back over London.</p>

<p>At last, when Ronnie and Beryl had climbed in
and settled themselves, the mechanic swung
over the propeller, the engine roared, and a few
moments later they had left the earth, speeding
higher and higher in the direction of London,
on their return to Harbury Court.</p>

<p>Collins, as soon as they had left, wound up the
electric wires connecting the little tin pans of
petrol at each corner of the field, and hid the
pans themselves in the hedge. Then, having
removed all traces of the machine&#8217;s presence
there, he started back on his three-mile walk to
the obscure little village in which he had taken
up his quarters.</p>

<p>Next day he relaxed his vigilance on the Manor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Farm and, with an elderly man, a retired schoolmaster
whom he had met in the bar of The
George, he went for a day&#8217;s fishing in the river
which ran outside the village.</p>

<p>The old man, whose name was Haddon, had a
wide knowledge of local affairs, and as soon as
Collins mentioned Mrs. Cator and her son, he
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! They had a very good manager in Mr.
Bush, but he went away about a month before
the war. He was a German, though he called
himself Belgian.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know he was a German?&#8221;
asked Collins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, because my daughter&#8217;s in the post-office
here, and she says that once or twice letters
came for him bearing a Dutch stamp, and
addressed to &#8216;Herr Büch,&#8217; which is a German
name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. That&#8217;s curious, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And there were some other curious facts, too.
Before the war two foreigners very often came
down to the Manor Farm to spend the week-end&mdash;gentlemen
from London. I met them once
or twice and heard them speaking in German.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Mr. Cator isn&#8217;t German, is he?&#8221; asked
Collins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who knows? Some Germans who&#8217;ve lived
here for years speak English so well that you
can&#8217;t tell,&#8221; declared the ex-schoolmaster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any reason for supposing that Cator
is a German?&#8221; inquired Collins. &#8220;If he&#8217;s
German, then what about his mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it doesn&#8217;t follow that his mother is
German. She may have been an English girl
who married a German, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If so, she certainly might be pro-German,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Collins remarked, as they sat together on the
river-bank eating their sandwiches.</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly think she is, because my daughter
tells me that old Emma Green&#8217;s girl, who was
housemaid at the Manor Farm when war was
declared, says that Mrs. Cator, her son, and one
of those gentlemen from London drank the health
of the Kaiser in champagne that night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did the girl tell your daughter that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she did. And I believe her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Collins was silent. These facts he had learnt
were highly important.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; Mr. Haddon went on, &#8220;nowadays
you dare not say anything about anybody you
suspect, for fear of being had up for libel. The
law somehow seems to protect the Germans in
our midst. I feel confident that the Cators are
a mysterious pair, and I told my suspicions to
Mr. Rouse, our police-sergeant in the village.
But he only shrugged his shoulders and said that
as far as he knew they were all right. So why,
after that, should anybody trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it not an Englishman&#8217;s duty to oust the
enemy?&#8221; Collins queried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is; but if the enemy can live under
laws which protect them, what can the average
man do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, do his best to assist the authorities!
The latter are not so blind as they lead the public
to believe, I assure you,&#8221; laughed Collins, who,
having learnt all he could from the ex-schoolmaster,
devoted the remainder of the afternoon
to angling, and with fair result.</p>

<p>Next day he strolled, at about ten o&#8217;clock in
the morning, in the direction of the Manor Farm,
apparently taking a morning walk. When he had
gone about a quarter of a mile, he met the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Cator in a golf suit and cap, accompanied by the
stranger who had come from London two days
previously, and a third man, tall, elderly, with a
short, greyish beard, and rather shabbily-dressed.</p>

<p>As they passed, Collins felt instinctively that the
grey-bearded man, having eyed him closely,
made some remark to his companions which
caused them to turn back and look after him. The
air-mechanic was, however, too discreet to turn
himself, but went on and, walking in a circle,
gave the Manor Farm a wide berth.</p>

<p>That evening, however, as soon as it grew
dark, he approached the place, taking up his
position at the same spot where he had stood
with his master and Miss Beryl&mdash;a point from
which he had a good view of the long, low farm-building.</p>

<p>He sank down into some undergrowth which concealed
him and lit a cigarette, there being nobody
near to smell the smoke. It was eight o&#8217;clock
when he arrived there, and the time passed very
slowly. Now and then the dogs in the yard
barked furiously, once at hearing his footsteps,
and again when somebody opened the back
door of the farmhouse and came outside. Now
and then a horse neighed, and once a dog barking
far away set the two watch-dogs barking in
response.</p>

<p>The hours went by, but Collins, lying on his
back sometimes smoking, sometimes dozing,
kept a most patient vigil.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, just before midnight, as
a glance at his watch revealed, he heard the sound
of a car coming up the hill. He sprang up and
listened. It was coming up behind him&mdash;up
the byway which led through the wood to the
farm!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>His heart beat quickly. Pryor had been
right. A lorry visited the Manor Farm every
three days.</p>

<p>Suddenly he caught a glimpse of the oil side-lights,
and a few minutes later a big motor-lorry,
heavily laden, approached and backed towards
the wide doors of the farm-building. The driver
having blown his horn, Cator and his visitor
came out, and, when the doors were unlocked and
wheeled open, the lorry was backed right into
the building.</p>

<p>At once all three men began unloading the
lorry, whereupon Collins crept up to ascertain
what was being taken out.</p>

<p>Crouching behind the lorry he saw a number
of full petrol tins being handed out and stored
away within, after which came small, square
wooden cases, which were handled very gingerly,
and placed quietly upon the concrete floor of
the well-filled building. Each case bore a red
disc, and by the manner in which the driver
warned Cator and his friend who handled them,
Collins learnt that they were high explosives.</p>

<p>The lorry had been practically laden with these
cases, save for twenty tins of petrol, and all
were safely transferred into the store. After
this the driver went into the house for some
refreshment, and in the meantime Collins, by
the aid of his flash-lamp, was enabled to slip
inside the building and make a quick examination
of its contents.</p>

<p>What he saw showed plainly that within that
place was stored a great quantity of petrol and
explosives&mdash;an enemy base for the use of the
Huns who so vainly hoped one day to reach
Britain.</p>

<p>Two minutes later, ere the trio again emerged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
from the house, the air-mechanic was on his way
back to the inn at Bricklehurst, well satisfied.</p>

<p>On the following Friday, at nine o&#8217;clock in
the evening, Beryl climbed into &#8220;The Hornet,&#8221;
which stood in its meadow behind Harbury Court
ready for a night flight. It had been a strenuous
day getting ready, but the machine was now in
perfect running order.</p>

<p>Ronnie, in his air-kit with leather cap and big
goggles, climbed in and buckled the strap round
his waist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s hope for good luck!&#8221; cried Beryl
standing at the propeller.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right, darling!&#8221; replied Ronnie. &#8220;Let her
rip!&#8221;</p>

<p>Next moment the girl swung round the propeller.
Then she climbed in, and a few moments
later the &#8217;plane sped over the grass and soon
crossed the roof of the house, and was away.</p>

<p>An hour later, with the lever of the silencer
thrown back, they were hovering noiselessly,
having passed over Guildford and away south,
above a fire they saw below them&mdash;a hay-rick
which belonged to the Cators. Collins had
ignited it at a given time that night, in order to
serve as their guide. The rick was in a field
fully half-a-mile from the farm, and from above
Ronnie and his companion could see that the
local fire brigade were around it.</p>

<p>The light, however, plainly illuminated the
Manor Farm, and the building containing the
secret store. Twice Ronnie passed over it,
flying high, then once again he crossed directly
above the farm. His hand was upon one of the
little levers controlling his bombs, but, seeing
that he had passed slightly to the south, he turned
her nose, and re-passed once again in silence.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>Suddenly he touched the three upper levers
in swift succession, one after the other.</p>

<p>There was a swish of air below in the darkness,
and as they watched, three blood-red flashes
showed far down almost simultaneously.</p>

<p>A noise like an earthquake rent the air, a great
column of flame shot up, and a huge explosion
resulted, lighting the country for miles around,
and sending <i>débris</i> high into the darkness, while
at the same time the terrible concussion tilted
up &#8220;The Hornet&#8221; until she very nearly had a
nasty side-slip.</p>

<p>Ronnie opened up his searchlight, shining it
down upon the farm, revealing to their gaze only
a wrecked and burning mass of ruins. The whole
place, including the farmhouse, had, by the
terrible force of the explosives stored there in
secret, been swept clean away and levelled to the
ground.</p>

<p>A few minutes later &#8220;The Hornet&#8221; turned
upon her homeward flight, and to this day it is
very naturally believed by the public that enemy
aircraft visited the spot on that memorable night.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>THE PRICE OF VICTORY.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> wintry night was dark and moonless. There
was a slight ground mist&mdash;and consequently
no wind.</p>

<p>Ronald Pryor returned to Harbury Court late
for dinner, where Beryl and her sister awaited
him. He had had a fagging day in London,
spending nearly half his time with officials of
the Air Department, who had at last become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
interested in his new engine silencer. Trials of it
had been made at Farnborough and elsewhere, and
proof of its effectiveness had been quite adequate.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Department have decided to adopt it!&#8221;
he announced triumphantly to Beryl as he
entered the long, old-fashioned stone hall, and
hung up his overcoat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew they would, dear!&#8221; cried the
enthusiastic air-woman joyously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only hope the secret won&#8217;t leak out to the
enemy,&#8221; he said, and then went along to wash
his hands before sitting down to dinner.</p>

<p>Presently, while they were at table, and Ronnie
was describing the interview he had had with
the heads of three Government Departments
and the reading of the confidential reports upon
the tests made with aeroplanes to which the
silencer had been fitted, the maid entered
announcing that he was wanted on the telephone.</p>

<p>He left the table, and five minutes later returned
with a grave look upon his countenance.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, dear?&#8221; asked Beryl
anxiously, for she dreaded lest something was
amiss.</p>

<p>For a few moments he did not answer, busying
himself with his plate. Then at last, he replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&mdash;well, only that I am flying &#8216;The
Hornet&#8217; again to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I not go with you?&#8221; Beryl asked eagerly.
&#8220;Do let me go. It is over a week since I went
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated. Truth to tell, what he had heard
on the telephone caused him some misgivings.
Over the wire a certain disguised message had
been given to him from headquarters&mdash;a request
to which he had acceded.</p>

<p>Beryl was in entire ignorance of the affair. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
had been asked to regard it as strictly confidential,
hence, he had not mentioned it, even to his well-beloved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, dearest,&#8221; he said at last, looking
across the big bowl of flowers in the centre of
the table, &#8220;I don&#8217;t half like you coming with me
to-night. There may be risk, and it is unfair
that you should take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are engaged, Ronnie; therefore, if there
is any danger, why should I not share it?&#8221; was
her prompt reply. &#8220;I am not afraid while I
am with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s quite the right spirit, Beryl,&#8221; remarked
her sister, approvingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I quite appreciate your bravery, little one,&#8221;
said Ronnie, &#8220;but flight on this misty night
is fraught with more danger than people ever
imagine. Once you are up you are lost, except
for your compass. And to descend is, as you
know, full of perils.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I quite appreciate all that,&#8221; said Beryl.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you recollect when I came over from
Sandgate to Folkestone, and found a thick fog
on this side? Well, I went on till I found a
break in it on the Surrey Downs, and descended
quite safely at Ash, near Aldershot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was in daylight&mdash;not on a dark night
like this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But where are you going?&#8221; she inquired.</p>

<p>To her question he remained silent. His was
a mission in strict confidence.</p>

<p>Further argument followed between the pair,
until at last, by the time dinner had ended,
Ronald Pryor was compelled to accede to her
request.</p>

<p>Then, taking a flash-lamp, he went forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
across the big meadow to the hangar and found
Collins awaiting him.</p>

<p>&#8220;All ready, sir,&#8221; the latter announced
cheerily. &#8220;I heard you quite well on the &#8217;phone
from London, but&mdash;well, sir,&#8221; he added
hesitatingly, &#8220;it&#8217;s a bit risky to fly to-night,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the machine all in order&mdash;everything?&#8221;
asked his master.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything, sir. She only requires wheeling
out,&#8221; and as he uttered the words the mechanic
opened the great sliding-doors of the hangar.</p>

<p>Then, together, the two men wheeled out the
aeroplane, and while Ronnie mounted into
the pilot&#8217;s seat Collins swung over the propeller,
and his master tuned up his engine.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Beryl having put on her air-woman&#8217;s
kit, with the leather jacket and cap,
joined her lover, whom she found in the hangar
poring over a map showing the East Coast between
the Wash and the estuary of the Thames.</p>

<p>He was taking measurements and making
some pencilled calculations, while she stood
expectantly beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, dear!&#8221; he asked at last, &#8220;are you
ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite!&#8221; was her reply, and a few moments
later, after he had put on his muffler, his overalls,
and leather coat, they both climbed into the
machine, and strapped themselves in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Light the flares about two o&#8217;clock, Collins.
I&#8217;m making a pretty long flight, so we can&#8217;t be
back before then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, tuning up again, and having tried the
silencer, and found it in good working order,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
he ran the machine swiftly across the frosty grass.
Soon he rose, and, skimming the trees, soon
soared away into the darkness.</p>

<p>From where Beryl sat she saw the glow of the
little electric bulb set over the instruments
shining into her lover&#8217;s strong clean-shaven
face, and, by the compass, gathered that they had
described a half-circle, and, though still rising
rapidly, were now heading eastward in the direction
of the sea. The roar of the engine, of course,
rendered speech impossible, while the mist was
very chilly causing her to draw her brown woollen
comforter around her cheeks. There was no
sign of light anywhere below&mdash;all was a great
black void.</p>

<p>They had flown for nearly half-an-hour when,
of a sudden, the long beam of a searchlight shot
up from somewhere on their left, and began slowly
to search the sky. Their approach had been
heard by one of our air-stations.</p>

<p>Ronnie, watching the light made no attempt
to evade it. Indeed, he switched on his searchlights
in order to reveal himself. He had no
wish to be peppered by our &#8220;Archies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next second both of them were blinded by the
searchlight full upon them. In a moment a
second, and then a third, light converged upon
them, so that the aviator and his well-beloved
were compelled to shade their eyes with their
gloved hands.</p>

<p>For a full three minutes the lights followed
them, when the watchers below, having examined
the tri-coloured rings on &#8220;The Hornet&#8217;s&#8221; planes
and being satisfied, shut off.</p>

<p>Beryl saw that her lover was anxiously watching
his altimeter, as well as his compass and clock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
It seemed as though he were apprehensive of
something.</p>

<p>Suddenly he began to descend, and pulled
across the lever controlling the silencer, thus
cutting off the noise of the exhaust.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re over the sea, now,&#8221; he remarked;
&#8220;can&#8217;t you feel the difference in the atmosphere?
Look on the left.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did so, peering down into the darkness,
and there saw the twinkling of a light&mdash;a ship
was signalling rapidly, being answered by another
not far away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are we going, dear?&#8221; Beryl inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;On a mission,&#8221; was his abrupt response.
And, though she pressed him for information,
he would vouchsafe no further reply.</p>

<p>For a full hour they flew over the North Sea,
due east, until suddenly they turned south, and
with the silencer still on, went along noiselessly
save for the shrill wind whistling in the struts.</p>

<p>From ten thousand feet they had now descended
to a little over two thousand, when, all of a
sudden, a distant searchlight shot forth.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the Belgian coast!&#8221; Ronnie remarked,
and once again he started to ascend, flying in a
complete circle and undecided as to exactly
where he might be. The single shaft of light, like
a moving line in the total darkness, was soon
followed by others from the same neighbourhood.
Circles of light could be seen, showing that the
clouds were low&mdash;a fact which would favour the
intrepid pair.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll give those lights a wide berth for a
little,&#8221; Ronnie said cheerfully, and again he turned
northward, and a little later to the south-east.</p>

<p>As they flew they watched those slowly-moving
searchlights until, one by one, they disappeared.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>&#8220;They&#8217;ve finished their sweep of the skies,&#8221;
he said at last, with satisfaction. &#8220;If there&#8217;s
no alarm they won&#8217;t open out again for some
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then he flew in the direction of where the
lights had been, descending until he was again
only about two thousand feet above the sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;From the disposition of those lights it seems
that we are near our objective,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;I
hope you are not nervous, darling?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I be with you, Ronnie?&#8221; she
asked, placing her gloved hand tenderly upon his
shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, because we&#8217;re now entering the danger-zone,&#8221;
he replied, &#8220;and I think I ought not to
conceal it from you. Would you like to turn
back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn back!&#8221; echoed the brave girl.
&#8220;Never! Where you dare go, I will go too.
Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m in the least nervous. If anything
happens, it will happen equally to both
of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well spoken, my darling,&#8221; he said, his hand
touching her cheek in the darkness. &#8220;Then we
will go forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>After that there was a long silence, until below
they saw a cluster of faint lights, with one light
flashing at regular intervals.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is Zeebrugge.
Beyond&mdash;that fainter light over there&mdash;is
Ostend.&#8221;</p>

<p>He consulted a roughly drawn map which he
now produced, and which bore certain cryptic
marks in red and blue; he directed Beryl&#8217;s attention
to a speck of light to the north, saying:
&#8220;That surely is Heyst!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he pointed &#8220;The Hornet&#8217;s&#8221; nose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
upwards, and rose until they were enveloped in a
cloud of fog in order to evade the inquisitiveness
of any searchlights, afterwards flying in a
circle directly over the port of Zeebrugge, which
both knew to contain strong defences and long-range
anti-aircraft guns.</p>

<p>For a full quarter of an hour they hovered over
the town, their presence entirely unsuspected on
account of the roaring exhaust being silenced.
Then, carefully, he once more descended to mark
out his objective&mdash;the new German submarine
base. Between two spots seen far below he was
undecided. There were many faint lights burning
in the town, but one, he decided, was in the centre
of the submarine base.</p>

<p>Without uttering a word to his companion, who
sat strapped in her narrow seat cramped, breathless,
and half-frozen, he passed and re-passed
over the German base three or four times.</p>

<p>Suddenly as he went a quick swish sounded
below them, and, peering down, Beryl saw a big
burst of flame, followed by a terrific explosion,
the concussion of which gave the machine a
serious tilt.</p>

<p>Bang!&mdash;bang!&mdash;<i>bang!</i> sounded so quickly in
succession that hardly had one ceased before the
other reached them.</p>

<p>Below, the bright red flashes, angry points of
light in the blackness of the night, showed vividly,
while at the moment that the searchlights shone
forth Ronnie, having dropped his bombs, climbed
swiftly into the bank of cloud.</p>

<p>Higher and higher they went, until below them
they only saw the clouds aglow with the glare,
whether by the incendiary fires they had caused
among the enemy or the searchlights they knew
not.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>&#8220;&#8216;The Hornet&#8217; has done considerable damage
this time!&#8221; Ronnie laughed hoarsely, as the
altimeter showed that they were still ascending.
&#8220;I saw that the second bomb dropped plumb
into the fitting-shop! It has, no doubt, put an
end to Fritz&#8217;s activity for a good many days
to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you intend doing now?&#8221; asked
Beryl. &#8220;Going home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Home? No. I&#8217;ve got four more bombs
for them, yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, however, they heard the sharp
bark of the enemy&#8217;s anti-aircraft guns. Yet no
shell whistled near them.</p>

<p>The Hun is a bully, and hence a coward.
Taken unawares, as he was at Zeebrugge that
night, when he heard nothing and saw nothing,
it was but natural that he should fire even into
the air in order to scare off the British raider.</p>

<p>But Ronald Pryor was not the man to be
scared off. He had had an objective to reach and
he had reached it, but he had not yet finished,
and did not intend to take any bombs back.</p>

<p>He knew that as long as he kept above the low
clouds, and as long as his machine was silent, as
it would remain, it would be impossible for the
gunners below to hit him. Therefore he drew
away seaward again, according to his compass,
then back to land, and for half-an-hour flew round
the little town of Heyst.</p>

<p>Now and then, as they passed from one cloud
to another, they watched the lights of Zeebrugge
searching for them, until it seemed that the alarm
had died down.</p>

<p>At two points, however, they could see great
fierce fires burning&mdash;conflagrations they had
caused in the heart of the submarine base. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of Ronnie&#8217;s bombs had, as was afterwards known,
dropped upon the oil-tanks, and, the blazing oil
having been scattered over a large area, had
caused devastation throughout the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark! What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Beryl holding
her breath, her quick ears having detected a
familiar sound.</p>

<p>Ronnie, listening, suddenly said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! I quite expected that&mdash;their airmen
are up, looking for us! Now we may have a
little excitement. Collins put the gun ready.
Is it all right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite,&#8221; said the girl. Long ago Ronnie had
taught her how to manipulate the Lewis gun.
Therefore, she placed her hand upon it and
drew the shoulder-piece towards her, swinging
the machine-gun easily upon its pivot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep cool, darling! Don&#8217;t fire till I tell you,&#8221;
he urged. &#8220;We&#8217;re going over the town again
to give them a farewell salute&mdash;all explosives
this time. I want to get those warehouses at
the docks! I can see them plainly now&mdash;the
fires show them up. By Jove, they&#8217;ll get a shock
when they find themselves bombed again, won&#8217;t
they?&#8221; and he laughed merrily as he turned
&#8220;The Hornet&#8217;s&#8221; nose back in the direction of
Zeebrugge. Flying as low as he dared, he
approached the spot where the red flames leapt
up far below, and the smoke greeted their nostrils
with increasing intensity.</p>

<p>By this time the searchlights had been switched
off, though Hun machines could be heard in the
air. Those who controlled the searchlights knew
that their aeroplanes would work best in the darkness,
being fitted with small searchlights themselves.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>Leisurely, Ronnie came over the town, flying
high and in silence, until, when just over where
the darting flames were showing up the buildings
all around, he suddenly released his remaining
bombs&mdash;all but one.</p>

<p>Terrific explosions sounded in quick succession,
and, though so far above, they could both feel
the concussion. Indeed, &#8220;The Hornet&#8221; very
narrowly escaped a serious nose-dive in consequence.
Next moment they saw that the row
of buildings facing the docks was aflame from end
to end, and beginning to burn almost as fiercely
as the submarine oil-depôt.</p>

<p>Ronnie, however, did not have it all his own
way.</p>

<p>Ten seconds after dropping those bombs, and
causing panic in the occupied Belgian port, the
sky was again ablaze with searchlights. At that
moment Ronnie was out of one cloud, and
travelling very swiftly into another.</p>

<p>The searchlights were, however, too quick for
him, and picked him up.</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; he grunted. &#8220;They&#8217;ve found us at
last! Now for home!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken when the anti-aircraft
guns from below commenced to bark sharply,
with now and then a deep boom. They could
both hear the shells whistling close to them, but
so high were they by this time that accurate aim
by the enemy was well-nigh impossible.</p>

<p>In such a circumstance the wisest course was
to fly in a wide circle, descending and ascending,
a course which Ronnie, expert airman that he
was, adopted.</p>

<p>Those were highly exciting moments! Beryl
held her breath. Her hand was upon the Lewis
gun, but her lover had given no order. In her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
observer&#8217;s seat she sat alert, eager, with every
nerve strained to its fullest tension. They were
in the danger-zone, surrounded by what seemed
a swarm of aeroplanes, which had ascended in
order to prevent their returning to sea.</p>

<p>The little bulb in front of Ronnie burnt on,
shedding its meagre light over instruments and
maps. Beryl saw by the altimeter&mdash;which she
had so often watched when flying the machine
alone&mdash;that they were up five thousand six
hundred feet.</p>

<p>The dark waters were beneath them. A stray
shell from the enemy would cast them both down&mdash;deep
down into the North Sea.</p>

<p>More than once they heard the whirr of an
aeroplane-engine quite close to them, but going
forward, slipping through the air without
noise, thanks to Pryor&#8217;s silencer, which the
authorities had now recognised as a remarkable
and highly useful invention in aerial warfare,
they managed to evade their adversaries. The
strain of it all was, however, terrible.</p>

<p>Upon the misty clouds below shone the glow
of searchlights from land and sea, lighting up
the billow mists, until they were quite picturesque
undulations, like a fairy landscape. Yet through
those mists they saw the deadly enemy flying
to and fro in search of them as they went out
to sea in silence.</p>

<p>Beryl watched it all from her observer&#8217;s seat.
She knew that their raid had been successful,
and that enormous damage had been done to
the Hun submarine base. On her left showed
the faint lights of Ostend, where she had spent
one summer with her sister Iris and her husband,
two years before the war. She had walked along
the Digue in a smart summer gown, and she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
gambled at <i>boule</i> and eaten ices in the great
Casino which, according to report, was now used
as a German hospital. Ah, how times had
changed! She had never dreamt that she would
be flying as an enemy over that sandy coast.</p>

<p>Ronnie, with all his wits about him, was
heading straight for the English coast north of
the Thames when, of a sudden, there arose from
the dark void below the rapid throb of an enemy
seaplane, which, a few seconds later, opened out
its searchlight.</p>

<p>A moment afterwards it had fixed &#8220;The
Hornet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then began a desperate fight for life. The
German aviator, having marked his prey, rose
like a hawk, and then bore down upon him
swiftly, his searchlight glaring into Beryl&#8217;s face
like some evil eye.</p>

<p>The girl unstrapped herself and rose in order
to be able to handle the machine-gun without
encumbrance, for they were now flying upon an
even keel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on, dear!&#8221; the pilot exclaimed, and
then suddenly he banked his machine over,
swerving away none too soon from the hostile
seaplane.</p>

<p>Again he worked up, avoiding the quick swoop
of his adversary, who suddenly opened fire.</p>

<p>A heavy shower of bullets passed them harmlessly,
whistling all around them, while from
somewhere&mdash;possibly from a German warship&mdash;a
high explosive shell burst perilously near them,
causing &#8220;The Hornet&#8221; to roll and wallow in a
most disconcerting manner.</p>

<p>Again and again Ronnie&#8217;s adversary fired
full upon him, but all to no purpose. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
suddenly a second machine came up from somewhere,
and that also let loose its machine-gun.
Quick spurts of blood-red flame showed first
upon one side then upon the other, yet Ronnie
remained quite cool, awaiting his chance of gaining
an advantage and to strike.</p>

<p>A piece of the high explosive shell had torn
the fabric of one of the planes. That was all
the damage they had sustained up to the present.
Surely no woman could ever have a more exciting
or so perilous an experience, midway between
sky and sea!</p>

<p>Suddenly, after climbing and diving, Ronnie
saw his opportunity, and, making a sudden
swerve, cried to Beryl:</p>

<p>&#8220;Get ready!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>Again he climbed, and as he rose past the
machine which was pressing him so closely,
he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>In an instant Beryl&#8217;s gun spluttered, sending
forth its leaden hail full into the centre of the
German machine. Beryl held her breath, and
watched the enemy&#8217;s searchlight quiver, rise, and
then suddenly pointing downwards, swiftly
become smaller and smaller as it descended
towards the sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone!&#8221; cried Ronnie with relief.
&#8220;Pilot and observer both killed, I should say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They must have dropped into the sea!&#8221;
gasped the girl, awe-stricken.</p>

<p>Next second, however, the other machine
loomed up to exact vengeance. Beryl had
swiftly replenished the gun with ammunition,
and was again in readiness for the word from her
lover to fire.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>Ronnie, fully alive to the fact that he was being
pressed by the second machine, dived and banked,
then climbed as rapidly as he could, yet,
alas! he could not shake off his pursuer.</p>

<p>In silence, with the wind whistling through
the struts and the piece of torn fabric flapping,
he pressed on, striving to escape from his relentless
pursuer, who, no doubt, intended to shoot
him down as reprisal for the destruction of his
Hun comrade.</p>

<p>Again the enemy machine opened out his
searchlight, and, holding him as a mark, fired
rapidly. For a moment Ronnie did not reply.
All his nerve was concentrated upon obtaining
the advantage a second time.</p>

<p>Up and down, to and fro, the two machines
banked, rose and fell, but Ronald Pryor
could handle his machine as though it were
part of himself. At last he drew up, and,
setting his teeth as he pointed &#8220;The Hornet&#8217;s&#8221;
nose direct at his adversary, he blurted
out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>Beryl laid the gun straight at the aeroplane,
touched it, and again death rained forth.</p>

<p>Yet almost at that very same moment the Hun
also opened fire. The spluttering was deafening
for a few seconds, when, to the girl&#8217;s alarm, she
suddenly saw her lover fall helpless and inert
over his instruments.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gad, Beryl,&#8221; he managed to gasp, &#8220;they&#8217;ve
got me&mdash;the brutes! Phew, how it burns!&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl, who had not for a second lost her
nerve, instantly realised the peril, and without a
moment&#8217;s delay&mdash;nay, even without a word&mdash;she
clambered across into the pilot&#8217;s seat and took
the levers, being compelled to crush past her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
wounded lover as she did so, and not knowing
the nature of his wound.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Beryl! Fight to the last!&#8221;
the man gasped. &#8220;Bank her, then go right
down and rise again. You may beat him off by
that. Try, darling! Do&mdash;do your best!&#8221; he
whispered, and then he sank back in the blackness
of unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Beryl, as an expert air-woman, knew all the
tricks of evasion while flying. She knew that her
lover&#8217;s advice was the best, and she carried it
out to the very letter.</p>

<p>Just as she banked, the Hun machine sent out
another splutter of lead. Those angry spurts
of red fire seemed to go straight into her face,
but, though the bullets tore more holes in the
fabric of the left plane and broke a strut, they
whizzed harmlessly past her.</p>

<p>It was truly a flight for life. Flying &#8220;The
Hornet,&#8221; as she was doing, she had no means by
which to retaliate or to drive off the enemy.
Their lives now depended upon her skill in manipulating
the machine. This she did with marvellous
judgment and foresight. To the very letter
she carried out the orders of the man now lying
back wounded and unconscious.</p>

<p>Beneath her breath she whispered a prayer to
Almighty God for assistance, and set her teeth.
Again the Hun seaplane spurted forth a venom
of fire upon her, but with a dexterous turn she
banked, and once more avoided him. He
intended to shoot her down into the black waters
below, but she had her wounded lover at her
side, and thought only of his welfare. She recollected
her own response when Ronnie had suggested
that she should remain at home, and when
she saw that cruel eye of bright light following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
her so steadily she grew more and more
determined.</p>

<p>At last she decided upon flying by the compass
quite straight towards the Essex coast, and
seeing if her adversary could overtake her. At
first it seemed a very perilous course, because
the Hun coming up behind, shot at her continually,
and once more the fabric was torn in
one place near her elbow. But as she flew on
in silence she all at once made a discovery. She
listened. Her pursuer was gradually overtaking
her. If he did, then she was entirely
defenceless, and must share the same terrible fate
as the machine that Ronnie had sent down into
the sea.</p>

<p>The tension of those fateful moments was
terrible. Yet she summoned all her woman&#8217;s
pluck&mdash;the pluck that had come to the female
sex in these days of war&mdash;and kept on flying
in the direction of home.</p>

<p>Her ear caught something, for it was trained
to the noise of aeroplanes.</p>

<p>Again she listened. That eye of light which
was following her so ruthlessly was still upon her,
yet by the noise, she knew that the hostile engine
was not firing correctly. The throb was not
even and incessant.</p>

<p>Had Providence intervened to save her?</p>

<p>She drew a long breath, and opened out so that
she put all speed into her machine. From the
pace she was going she knew that the wind had
sprung up, and in her favour, too. &#8220;The Hornet&#8221;
was a fast machine, yet the Huns had machines
quite as mobile, and she had no means of knowing
the make of aeroplane against which her speed
was pitted.</p>

<p>She flew&mdash;flew as no woman had ever flown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
before. Half-crushed beneath her in the pilot&#8217;s
seat lay Ronnie, oblivious to everything. She
had placed her arm tenderly round his neck, but
on withdrawing her hand in the darkness she
had felt it strangely sticky&mdash;sticky with blood!</p>

<p>Ronald Pryor was evidently wounded in the
neck. Perhaps he was already dead. He might
have been, for all the brave girl knew. But that
sound of the mis-firing of her enemy gave her
courage, and she kept on&mdash;on and on&mdash;until,
very slowly, she drew away from that bright evil
eye that was bent upon her destruction.</p>

<p>Again came a splutter of lead upon her. Again
she knew that bullets had gone through the fabric,
but no great damage had been done to the
machine.</p>

<p>She feared more for the petrol-tank than for
herself. A shot in the bottom of that tank
would mean a certain dive into the sea. Of a
sudden another spurt of fire showed deep below
them, and a shell coming up from somewhere,
friendly or hostile she could not tell, exploded,
and nearly wrecked them both. It was from some
ship at sea&mdash;a British ship, no doubt, which,
seeing aircraft with a searchlight going in the
direction of the East coast at that hour of the
morning, had naturally opened fire upon it.</p>

<p>At last, after nearly half-an-hour, Beryl still
with her eye upon the compass and sailing again
upon an even keel and in an increasing wind,
glanced over her shoulder and saw the light of
the enemy grow dimmer, and then gradually
disappear. She had entered a thick cloud, and
sailing on in silence, would, she knew, be at once
lost to the view of her enemy.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, when Beryl at last realised
that she had escaped, she again placed her left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
arm tenderly round her lover and endeavoured
to raise him, but without avail.</p>

<p>Was he dead? The thought struck her
with horror! He had done what had been asked
of him, but perhaps he, like so many others, had
paid the toll of war!</p>

<p>Though perhaps her hand trembled a little
upon the levers, yet she settled herself again
as well as she could, and with her eye upon both
map and compass she sped along over those
dark waters, tossed by the increasing wind which
had arisen behind her.</p>

<p>For nearly two hours she flew on. By dint of
great effort she managed to move Ronnie into
a position which she hoped might be more comfortable.
She spoke to him, but there was no
answer. He lay there inert and motionless,
strapped in his seat. When she withdrew her
ungloved hand it was again wet with blood.</p>

<p>She pressed forward, putting &#8220;The Hornet&#8221;
along at the full pace of which the machine was
capable. The little clock showed the hour to be
nearly three, therefore she judged that she must
be nearing the English coast again. Her surmise
proved correct, for ten minutes later she saw the
glimmer of a searchlight on the sky straight ahead&mdash;the
light of one of our air-stations. Therefore,
turning slightly to the north, she again opened
the silencer as a precaution, and, with her
engine suddenly roaring, made straight for it.</p>

<p>Ere long half-a-dozen beams of intense light
were searching the skies for the incoming machine,
which the watchers below were eager to examine,
and it was not long before one of the beams
caught and held &#8220;The Hornet&#8221; in its blinding
rays, lighting up the white, inanimate face beside
her, and showing the dark stain of wounds.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>Then three other beams became concentrated
for a few moments upon her, and again, one after
another, shut off, until she was once more in
darkness.</p>

<p>The position of the lights, however, told her
where she was&mdash;over a certain town a few miles
inland, and taking her bearings, she rose higher,
and began to describe a wide circle in order to
find the four bright flares which she knew Collins
had lit in the meadow at Harbury.</p>

<p>Another half-hour she spent in vain search,
until, of a sudden, she saw points of light deep
down on her left. Straining her eyes she managed
at last to make out that there were four, looking
close together from that height. Therefore she
quickly descended, while as she did so she saw
Morse flashes from a signal-lamp telling her the
direction of the wind, in order that she might
land head on to it.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later she came safely to earth,
when Collins ran up, having chased the machine
across the field.</p>

<p>In a moment Beryl told him with breathless
haste what had occurred, and with but few words
they at once carried Ronald back to the house,
and laid him upon the sofa in the study. Then
Collins rushed to the car, and drove away madly
to fetch the nearest doctor.</p>

<p>The latter arrived with but little delay, and
Beryl, her sister&#8217;s arm round her, stood outside
the door, awaiting his verdict.</p>

<p>The examination occupied some time, but at
last the medical man came forth.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is very severely wounded, Miss Gaselee,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;but there is still a spark of life left&mdash;a
very meagre spark. By careful attention and
nursing he may possibly pull through. He is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
not yet conscious, but we will put him to bed,
and I will remain and see what I can do. We
can only hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beryl, thankful that Ronnie still lived, quickly
bestirred herself for his comfort, and it was not
long before the senseless man was carried up to
his own room, where the doctor remained watching
him for many hours.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Days passed&mdash;days of breathless and terrible
anxiety&mdash;during which the doctor forbade Beryl
to see the wounded man. In the papers there
had been published accounts of the enormous
damage done to the enemy submarine base at
Zeebrugge by a &#8220;British aeroplane,&#8221; but the name
of the intrepid aviator was not given. Only the
authorities and those at Harbury Court knew the
truth. The authorities preserved a wise reticence,
for the publication of facts is not always in the
interests of the country.</p>

<p>Ronnie&#8217;s wounds proved far more serious than
were at first believed, and even the specialist
who came down from Harley Street was not at
all hopeful of his recovery. Nevertheless, the
fine physique of the patient proved in his favour,
and a fortnight later Beryl was allowed to see
him for the first time.</p>

<p>From that moment Beryl became his nurse,
and slowly he recovered; slowly, because both
his right arm and his right leg had been so injured
that they would be entirely useless in future,
and he could never fly again.</p>

<p>Only the thought of his invention, and the great
advantage it would give to our aviators for night-flying
in the future, comforted him, when at last
he was able to be wheeled about in his chair by
Beryl.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>And was it surprising that when, three months
later, the pair were married in the old, ivy-clad,
church, half-a-mile from Harbury Court, the
illustrated papers published a pathetic picture of
the bridal couple emerging from the porch, the
bridegroom on crutches, and described it as &#8220;a
romantic war-wedding&#8221;?</p>
